One Textarea
============

[Image Omitted]
 Every single web form on earth can (and will) be represented in a single textarea as plain text with no visible syntax using Particles or a similar 2D notation. Traditional forms can still be used as a secondary view. In this demo gif we see someone switching between one textarea and a traditional form to fill out an application to YCombinator. As this pattern catches on, the network effects will take over and conducting business on the web will become far faster and more user friendly (web 4.0?).

Forget all the "best practices" you've learned about web forms.

_Everyone is doing it wrong_.

The true best practice is this: every web form on earth can and will be replaced by a single textarea.

Current form technology will become "classic forms" and can still be used as a fallback.

The Web Form Gravy Train
========================
Being in the web form business is great.

Users have a simple problem which is easy to solve so you never get lost about the ultimate task to done.

But along the way, you are instructed by your employer and by "best practices" to add loads of unnecessary complexity that you get to work on while drinking lattes and working remote.

Dozens of fields. Complex logic. Multiple pages. Client side and server side validation. Server side session storage. Helper routes.

So much can go wrong! So much to bill for!

In my career I've been paid over a half million dollars to write web forms for Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Visa, PayPal, and many more. I've traveled the world off my web form earnings. It's crazy—the worse the user experience, the more they pay me.

I try to argue for what users want: simple, fast, transparent, trustworthy, but no one listens. They are afraid to think different. No one understands language oriented programming. No one understands you don't ever need parentheses. No one wants to stray from the herd and be first.

Even Stripe sucks
=================

Stripe is the poster child for web form "experts". And Stripe sucks compared to the demo I released 8 years ago. I still can't do copy/paste with Stripe forms or instant eReceipts or work on forms offline.

How it works
============

This is the early days, think web forms in 1990's. So it's a little bit of work to implement, until tooling and libraries improve.

But it basically boils down to 3 steps:

1. *Arrange*. Define your form as a "microlang" in Parsers.

2. *Accept*. Put a textarea on your web page and use the ScrollSDK and your Parsers microlang to turn it into a rich-text editor.

3. *Analyze*. Save form submissions as files on your server and use Scroll to compile them to TSV or whatever you need.

A Golden Opportunity
====================
If you're smart, honest and ambitious and you know the web stack boy oh boy is there a golden opportunity here. All my web forms now are one textarea and we are seeing exceptional results. Please go get rich bringing this technology to the masses. When you're rich you don't have to thank me—if I come across your form in the wild and it saves me time that will be thanks enough.
