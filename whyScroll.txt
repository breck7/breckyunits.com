Everything I own is in the overhead bin.

This is cool if you are 20.

But I am 40. I have two kids.

At 40 this is a bit extreme.

*

The kid next to me is 20.

She is a computer science major.

We talk about languages.

I play dumb and mostly listen.

*

She is wondering which language to use.

Her ML class uses Python.

Her OS class, C++.

For fun, she uses Javascript.

*

I suggest she enjoy them all.

It's like traveling.

Learn the place in front of you.

You will visit many.

*

The topic comes to my work.

I used to be shy about it.

Terrified of misleading.

Not anymore. I demo.

*

Scroll is very practical.

We make useful things fast.

Right there on the plane.

With no internet.

*

I explain Scroll is like a game.

To play you put a subject into symbols.

To win you cover it all with no extra parts.

The prize is you've figured it out.

*

To pack so light I've filtered objects.

Kept only the most useful ones.

To write Scroll is to filter symbols.

To keep only the most useful ones.
