title Some old blogs

I found it mildly interesting to dig up my earlier blogs and put them in this git. This folder contains some old blogs started in 2007 and 2009. This would not have been possible without the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine heart ❤️.

# August 2007 - Running Wordpress on my own domain

It looks like I registered breckyunits.com on August 24th, 2007. It appears I used Wordpress <a class="wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070907182730/http://www.breckyunits.com/">🕸</a>. There's a Flash widget on there. The title of the site is "The Best Blog on the Internet". I think it was a good joke. I had just recently graduated college, and had not yet moved to the West Coast.

# July 2009 - Two years of Wordpress
About two years later, my Wordpress blog had grown to many pages <a class="wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090713043922/http://breckyunits.com/">🕸</a>.

# August 2009 - Switched to Posterous
Looks like I started transitioning to a new site <a class="wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090813063739/http://breckyunits.com/">🕸</a> , and moved my blog from my own server running Wordpress to posterous <a class="wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307210904/http://breck7.posterous.com/">🕸</a>.

After I moved to posterous, I put up this homepage <a class="wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091103021126/http://www.breckyunits.com/">🕸</a>.

# December 2009 - Switched to Brecksblog
In December 2009 I wrote my own blog software called <a href="https://github.com/breck7/brecksblog.">brecksblog</a> Here's what my new site looked like <a class="wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091204020806/http://breckyunits.com/">🕸</a>.

I kept it simple. My current homepage now powered by Scroll evolved from brecksblog.

# December 2009 - My "Computer science" blog
It looks like I also maintained a programming blog from December 2009 to January 2012 <a class="wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531162851/http://breckyunits.com/code/">🕸</a>. Here is that blog migrated to Scroll.
