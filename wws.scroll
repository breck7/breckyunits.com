After years of development, I'm looking for beta testers for The World Wide Scroll (WWS).

The WWS is like the World Wide Web, except:

- *Offline.* You download entire sites and browse completely offline locally, rather than fetching one page at a time.
- *Pristine.* No ads, no paywalls, no trackers, no cookies, no copyright.
- *Human.* Instead of domains the WWS has folders owned by humans, not AIs or corporations.
- *Trustworthy.* Source code behind every page.
- *Intelligent.* Built from the ground up in a simple, expandable language.

If you know someone who might find this interesting, I'd appreciate it if you could share this with them.

The link to register a folder is:
https://scroll.pub/wws.html

The price to own a folder is $100 for 10 years.

Funds pay for the development of the Scroll language.

Mahalo!
