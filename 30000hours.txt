30,000 Hours
============

July 18, 2019

In 2013 I sent a brief email to 25 programmers whose programs I admired.

"Would you be willing to share the # of hours you have spent practicing programming?

Back of the envelope numbers are fine!"

Some emails bounced back.

Some went unanswered.

But five coders wrote back.

This turned out to be a tiny study, but given the great code these folks have written, I think the results are interesting--and a testament to practice!

My Conclusion
=============
No evidence has been found that the 10,000 hour strategy is flawed. :)

Thank You
=========
I hope these data points can encourage other aspiring programmers as much as they encouraged me.

I am eternally grateful to the programmers who responded.

Back then I was 5 years into my programming career, I had passed 10,000 hours of practice, and was starting to worry that the "10,000 hour strategy" I had been following and telling other aspiring programmers to follow may have been in vain, because I was still a pretty bad programmer (many would argue that today, 6 years later, I'm not much better, but now I can say that's just because I only have 29,000 hours of practice).

These busy coders answered my cold emails with not just a number but many encouraging words and thoughts.

One of my favorite responses was from Peter Norvig, who sent me a Python program computing his estimate:

# sum(years *  (hours/week)) * (weeks/year)

(4 * 10 # college
+ 2 * 30 # first job
+ 5 * 20 # grad school
+ 6 * 20 # faculty, research faculty
+ 6 * 25 # programming jobs
+ 15 * 10 # management jobs
) * 48

Thank you everyone!

Notes
=====
I promised I would compile the responses and publish the results to the public domain.

But, while waiting for more responses to trickle in, I slowly forgot about this project.

Until this morning (7/18/2019), when I stumbled upon one of those old emails.

Sorry for the delay!
