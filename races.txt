"I don't care for the heels", she said.

I knelt.

*

A twig had fallen from the oak we were sitting under.

"Look at this," I said.

I bent the end of the twig and snapped off a one inch piece.

I snapped off another. Then another. And another.

*

"Your neighbor, the heel, he's younger than you right?"

"Sure is. Has no respect for his elders. None of the heels do."

*

I aligned the twigs into a staggered line.

I pointed at the twig in front.

*

"Think of this piece of twig as your neighbor.

And think of this twig as his father.

The line is staggered because his dad probably had him in the middle of his life. Not the end."

*

I grabbed a second twig and started laying out a second line.

"Why are you making another line?"

*

"Well, we usually count someone's age as the time elapsed since they were born. That would just be the length of this one twig.

But imagine if we counted someone's age as the length of all these twigs that represent their lineage."

*

I finished placing the 12th piece of twig and took a slow, deep breath.

*

"This right here, this is you. And this staggered twig is your dad. And this one, your grandfather. And so on and so on.

Science tells us something amazing. When we measure people's age like this, our 'genetic' age, then all of us humans alive today, you, me, the heels, we are all _exactly_ the same genetic age, down to the millisecond."

*

I gestured to her line of twigs.

*

"Now, think about all the trials and tribulations all your ancestors went through to get you here today. I bet they went through a lot?"

"Sure did. We Devlins didn't have anything handed to us. Tough folk."

"I believe you. Look at how many twigs it took to get you here!"

*

I pointed again to the first line.

"Now, look at this line again. The exact same huge number of twigs had to survive for your neighbor to get here too. The lines of the Devlins and the Heels have been through just as much over millions of years."

*

"Hmmmmmm. I never thought about it like that."
