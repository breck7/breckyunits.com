title Turning down the Nobel Prize

startColumns 2

On November 1st CancerDB.com will launch and immediately start saving lives. The Nobel Foundation will probably be in a rush to award a Nobel Prize to the CancerDB team. That would be the sensible thing to doâ€”a team with name brands like Duke University, Microsoft, YCombinator, St. Jude, MD Anderson, UH Cancer Center, led by a white male. I would like to preemptively declare that we will refuse such an award until after a Nobel Prize has been given to the woman who made it all possible, a 33 year old in Russia named Alexandra Elbakyan. This is for you, our Pirate Queen.
