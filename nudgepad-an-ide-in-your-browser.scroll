 Making websites is slow and frustrating.

paragraph
 I met a young entrepreneur who wanted to create a website
 for his bed and breakfast. He had spent dozens of hours
 with different tools and was no closer to having what he
 wanted.

paragraph
 I met a teacher who wanted his students to turn in web
 pages for homework instead of paper pages. No existing
 tool allows his students to  easily create pages without
 restricting their creativity.

paragraph
 I met an artist who wanted a website with a slideshow for
 her portfolio.

paragraph
 A restaurant owner who wanted a website that could take
 online orders.

paragraph
 An author who wanted a website with a blog.

paragraph
 A saleswoman who wanted to build a members-only site for
 great deals she  gathered.

paragraph
 A candidate who wanted a website that could coordinate his
 volunteers.

paragraph
 A nonprofit founder who wanted a website that told the
 story of impoverished children in his country and accepted donations.

paragraph
 These are just a handful of real people with real ideas who
 are frustrated by the current tools.

section The problem

paragraph
 The fact is, people want to do millions of
 different things  with their websites, but the only two
 options are to use a tool that limits your creative
 potential or to program your site from scratch. Neither
 option is ideal.

section The solution

paragraph
 Which is why we're building a third option. We are building
 an open source, general purpose IDE for building websites.

 NudgePad is in early beta, but is powering a number of live websites  like these:

 Although we have a lot more to do to get to a stable
 version 2.0, we thought the time was right to start
 opening up NudgePad to more people and recruiting more help
 for the project. We also want to get feedback on the core ideas in
 NudgePad.

paragraph
 To get involved, give NudgePad a try or <a

 on GitHub.</a>

paragraph
 We truly believe this new way to build websites--an IDE in
 your browser-- is a faster way to build websites and the
 way it will be done in the future. By this time next year,
 using NudgePad, it could be 100x faster and easier to build
 websites than it is today.
