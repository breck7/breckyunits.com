Copyright is a mind virus
=========================

October 29, 2024

The censors do not want you to read this post.

They will downvote, flag, takedown, block and use any and all means to suppress these ideas.

They will call me names: a crank, crazy, unhinged, conspiracy theorist, lunatic.

They will say he is not a creator (I am), has created no hits (I have) and whatever else they can do to suppress this, short of responding to the ideas presented here.

Because they know that if they respond to the ideas then they will encourage you to actually think about them, and they know that if you start to think about them they've lost, because they know what I'm telling you is nature's simple truth.

That terrifies the censors. They know the stickiness of truth. They know that truths can be hard to see, but once you've seen truth you can't unsee it. Brains prefer shortcuts. And truths are shortcuts for predicting the world.

I'm giving you a shortcut to explain many of the problems in modern America: unnatural inequality, poor health, declining life expectancy, violence, poverty, misinformation, fake news, distrust in media, et cetera.

What is a shortcut to explain the root cause of many of these health problems?

Copyrights.

Copyrights they tell you are helping us are actually hurting us.

Copyright pauses progress
=========================

Every single great idea started as a bad idea that evolved in a competitive environment into a great idea.

This applies to any and every great work that has a © slapped on it: every song, book, article, photo, movie, program, et cetera.

No idea ever reaches perfection.

Every idea can always be improved. Every idea can always keep evolving.

What does copyright do? It makes evolution a crime.

It says: no more evolving! This idea needs to stay exactly as is until 70 years after the "owner" dies!

This is literally the dumbest idea I can think of, short of total censorship.

Copyright is a mind virus
=========================

But copyright is even worse than just being a terrible idea: it's a terrible idea that has spread like a virus.

For example, 9 out of 10 of the top websites in the USA spread the virus to all their visitors. And the one that doesn't have the virus on its homepage, Google.com, has the virus on most of its other pages.

Copyright has no redeeming qualities, except for enriching a few at the expense of the many.
============================================================================================

You can listen to every argument made by the spreaders of this virus, but you will not find a single honest one.

All of their arguments are mathematically flawed.

Their best strategy is not to actually convince you they are right-they know they are wrong-but to delay you from seeing this obvious truth as long as possible, because they make so much money every year you don't see it.

If you want to read honest material about this, here's a place to start.

Fight the Virus
===============

You can help! If you run one of these companies, start cleaning up your house! Remove all © symbols from all pages. Remove all uses of the word "license" when talking about ideas. Make it clear that everything you are publishing is public domain.

If you are just an average citizen, you can help too! Tell everyone you know about the harmful effects of the © mind virus. If you have technical skills, start sending pull requests removing the © virus from open source projects.

Together we can rid the world of this mind virus and create a world where bad ideas are once again forced to evolve into good ideas.
