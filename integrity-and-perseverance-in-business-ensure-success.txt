 A poster from the 1850's promoting Folsom's Mercantile College in Ohio. The poster includes a motto (which I boxed in green) that I think is great guidance: _Integrity and Perseverance in Business ensure success_. Image Source.

Folsom's taught bookkeeping, banking, and railroading.

Their motto was: "Integrity and Perseverance in Business ensure success".

Guess who went there?
