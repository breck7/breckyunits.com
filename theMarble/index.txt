Once upon a time there was a dad and his two daughters.

"I have to go on a trip girls"

*

"But I have a gift for you."

*

"It's a glass marble, made from melted sand."

*

The girls loved to play with the marble.

One time they brought it to the beach.

*

"Uh oh. The marble is all sandy."

*

"I'll wash it", said Sage.

*

"Oh no!"

"What happened?", asked Mazie.

*

[Image Omitted]

"I dropped the marble down the drain!"

*

[Image Omitted]

"Don't worry Sage. We will find it together"

Mazie called their uncle.

"Uncle, where does the water go after it goes down the drain?"

*

[Image Omitted]

"The water goes through pipes to the treatment plant. Maybe your marble went there."

So the girls walked to the treatment plant.

*

"Did you see a marble?"

"No, but our filter catches things like marbles, and a truck takes that to the landfill"

*

So the girls walked to the landfill.

*

[Image Omitted]

"Did you see a marble?"

"No, but someone might have found it. Try posting a message to the Internet."

*

[Image Omitted]

They got many messages.

But no one found their marble.

*

The girls were sad.

"Daddy gets homes tomorrow and is gonna be sad we lost the marble."

But then...

*

[Image Omitted]

"I have an idea!" shouted Mazie.

*

[Image Omitted]

The girls went back to the beach with their uncle.

He helped them make something.

The next day...

*

[Image Omitted]

"DADDY! DADDY!"

Their dad was home.

They gave him a big hug.

"We lost the marble, but made a new one!"

And they showed it to him.

*

[Image Omitted]

"Girls! I am so proud of you."

"This is the most magnificent marble I have ever seen."

"We love you daddy."

"I love you too girls".
