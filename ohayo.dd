I just pushed a project I've been working on called <a href="http://ohayo.computer">Ohayo</a>.

You can also view it on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/treenotation/ohayo">https://github.com/treenotation/ohayo</a>

I wanted to try and make a fast, visual app for doing data science. I can't quite recommend it yet, but I think it might get there. If you are interested you can try it now.
