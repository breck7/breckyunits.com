Nobody talks about how Bill Gates _actually_ made his billions.

Nobody talks about how Larry Ellison _actually_ made his billions.

Nobody talks about how Larry and Sergey _actually_ made their billions.

Nobody talks about how Jeff Bezos _actually_ made his billions.

There's a Secret.

The reason nobody talks about the Secret is because the people who effectively control what we talk about make their millions in the same way. Talking about the Secret is a surefire way to get kicked out of the club.

Technology is abolutely incredible. Not just because of what it can do, but because of how hard it was to create. How much blood, sweat, and tears from tens of millions of people over hundreds of years went into learning the patterns of our universe and helping evolve technologies to manipulate it.

It is such a shame that this industry is controlled by people who use the Secret to extract rent and control the population. Who try and pretend their extraordinary wealth comes from value creation, and not the legal chains of the Secret. Who disrespect the great work of the countless brave and selfless souls who gave their time to build a better world for their descendants, only to see things locked up by these "tech titans" and their cronies in Congress and the media. Who will lead our country to ruin to protect their Secret and their wealth.

I respect the work ethic and intelligence and leadership skills of the people above. But I don't respect their integrity.

It makes me sad that so many young people get caught up chasing the same scale of fortunes as the people above, not realizing that "dishonesty" and the Secret is the _crucial_ ingredient to their _extraordinary_ "success".

It makes me sad that so few can see the Secret.

It's hidden by its ubiquity.
