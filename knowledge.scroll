1. Human population has grown exponentially.
 // Currently it is ~8 billion.
 // 8e9

2. Words are 2D signals that can convey information about the 4D world.

3. The maximum number of words generated per year is a constant times human population.
 // If we set the constant to 10 million then the max words per year is:
  1e7 * 8e9 = 8e16

4. Written words persist and so the maximum number of written words increases by maximum number of words generated.

5. The maximum number of words a human can perceive per year is a constant.

6. It follows from the above that humans perceive a decreasing percentage of the world's total words per year.

7. Knowledge is words that make accurate predictions of many more words.

8. Noise is words that don't predict many more words.

9. Patterns in words are sometimes recognized and formed into knowledge words.

10. The fundamental generators of the patterns in the 4D world seem to be static, but may not be.
 // Could new forces arise over time? Do new forces assembly and evolve just like everything else?

11. The absolute number of knowledge words increases over time.

12. Knowledge seems to grow logarithmically.
// measured as the growth of the english language over time?

13. If one ruthlessly focuses on knowledge over noise, one may predict more of the 4D world than their ancestors.

// what about how things like new kinds of microscopes and telescopes, etc, show us more over time?
 // on that topic, what about writing an essay about light/causality/observation? seeing deeper, further, etc
// what is the growth in knowledge over time?
// what is the compression rate of words to knowledge?
// quickPlot year vs humanPopulation
// An offline dictionary of equations would be cool
// Topological dictioanry of equations?

// Intelligence is compression
