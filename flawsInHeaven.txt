A Redditor gets hit by a truck

He goes to the afterlife.

*

It's amazing.

Mansions for everyone.

Gourmet meals.

Perfect sunsets.

*

But the Redditor is able to find a few negative things to focus on.

He writes an email to God with subject "Flaws in Heaven".

*

He gets an immediate response.

```
MESSAGE NOT DELIVERED

Heaven doesn't want to hear
your  bullshit, that's why
they sent you here.
