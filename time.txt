Two people in the same forest,
have the same amount of water and food,
Are near each other, but may be out of sight,
The paths behind each are equally long.
The paths ahead, may vary.
One's path is easy and clear.
The other's is overgrown and treacherous.
Their paths through the forest,
in the past, in the present, and ahead
are equal.
Their journeys can be very different.
