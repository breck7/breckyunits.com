# A Suggested Improvement to Progress Bars

When I was a programmer at Microsoft I participated in a lot of internal betas.

So I saw a lot of animated "progress" bars in software that was actually hung.

_I bet you could invent a better progress bar_, I thought.

But life went on and I forgot.

Yesterday my FitBit app showed an animated progress bar for hours. It turned out no progress was being madeâ€”the phone had no Internet connection.

But it made me remember my progress bar idea!

<div id="chart"></div>
<style>
    .area-remainingSuccesses { fill: rgb(101,170,102); }
    .area-remainingAborts { fill: rgb(208,85,87); }
    .area-stillWaiting { fill: rgba(93,121,181, 0.5); }
 </style>
<script src="d3.v6.min.js"></script>
<script defer src="abortBar.js"></script>

Every time someone starts a long task, measure the end result and duration. Then you can render a progress bar like the one above.

For any given time, it shows what percent of people remaining would eventually see success, or end up aborting.

It helps your users decide: should I wait or abort?


// There are some significant opportunities to improve this design further. I would love to see your iterations.

// it is also interesting to think about abort bars in the context of life.
