Chemical Blood Tests Dataset
============================

This file generates a TSV dataset of blood chemistry tests. I created it for the blog post "Ketones vs Lithium".

It is specific to blood chemistry tests. So there are no urine tests. And it is not about blood cell tests. And it does not gain blood gas tests. Generally it is a collection of information on levels of chemicals in blood plasma.

This dataset was created to see how common it is for the target levels of certain chemicals in blood to fall between 0.8 and 3.0 mmol/L.

At some point, I would like to add fields to get some measure on how popular each test is. Also, I want to add categories for each test (ie, electrolytes, Hormones, etc), and what the test method is (for example, Ion-Selective Electrode, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry or Flame Emission Spectroscopy). I also want to add chemical formulas. It is likely that all the measures I would want to add are already present in HMDB.
