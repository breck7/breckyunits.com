<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 26, 2024 — </span>I went to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastination">plastination</a> exhibit for the first time last week.

I salute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunther_von_Hagens">Gunther von Hagens</a>, who pioneered the technique. You probably learn more anatomy walking around a plastination exhibit for 2 hours then you would learn in 200 hours reading anatomy books. There are a number of new insights I got from my visit, that I will probably write about in future posts, but one insight I hadn't thought about in years is how much humans and animals look alike once you open us up! And then of course I was confronted again with that lifelong and uncomfortable question that I usually like to avoid: humans and animals are awfully similar, is it morally wrong to eat animals? I thought now was as good a time as any to blog about it, thus forcing myself to think about it.</p><a class="scrollContinueReadingLink" href="eatingAnimals.html">Continue reading...</a></div>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 24, 2024 — </span>Assuming I keep blogging, which I hope I manage to do, I expect my posts will largely be about bipolar disorder. I've been blogging for fifteen years but never wrote publicly about bipolar disorder, even though I was diagnosed twenty years ago. I kept my diagnosis a secret.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Bipolar disorder</a> is a condition not yet understood, with no cure, and is predictive of disruptive behavior. So I very much understand why society discriminates against those with the label.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I did not keep my diagnosis a secret maliciously, but genuinely remained unsure how to handle it, and ultimately, optimistically, believed I would figure the thing out. But—like a Greek tragedy—my efforts to avoid my fate perhaps led me faster to it. My mania in 2022 was at least twice as strong as anything I ever experienced. Things went KABOOM!</p>

If the tide went out for me I'd pick up a book on a new programming language so that when the tide came back in I'd be better equipped to contribute more. I also thought that the more society invested in words, the better off society would be. New words and word techniques from scientific research helped us invent new technology and cure disease. Improvements in words led to better legal and commerce and diplomatic systems that led to more justice and prosperity for more people. My read on history is that it was words that led to the start of civilization, words were our present, and words were our future. <strong>Words were the safe bet</strong>.</p><a class="scrollContinueReadingLink" href="wordsAreWorseThanWeights.html">Continue reading...</a></div>

<p class="scrollParagraph"><a href="https://truebase.pub">TreeBase</a> is a new system I am working on for long-term, strongly-typed collaborative knowledge bases. The design of TreeBase is dumb. It's just a folder with a bunch of files encoded with <a href="https://treenotation.org">Tree Notation</a>. A row in a normal SQL table in TreeBase is roughly equivalent to a file. The filenames serve as IDs. Instead of each using an optimized binary storage format it just uses plain text like UTF-8. Field names are stored alongside the values in every file. Instead of starting with a schema you can just start adding files and evolve your schema and types as you go.</p><a class="scrollContinueReadingLink" href="building-a-treebase-with-6.5-million-files.html">Continue reading...</a></div>

<blockquote class="scrollQuote">There's a man in the world who is never turned down, wherever he chances to stray;
he gets the glad hand in the populous town, or out where the farmers make hay;
he's greeted with pleasure on deserts of sand, and deep in the aisles of the woods;
wherever he goes there's the welcoming hand--he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods.

The failures of life sit around and complain; the gods haven't treated them white;
they've lost their umbrellas whenever there's rain, and they haven't their lanterns at night;
men tire of the failures who fill with their sighs the air of their own neighborhoods;
there's one who is greeted with love-lighted eyes--he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods.

One fellow is lazy, and watches the clock, and waits for the whistle to blow;
and one has a hammer, with which he will knock, and one tells a story of woe;
and one, if requested to travel a mile, will measure the perches and roods;
but one does his stunt with a whistle or smile--he's The Man Who Delivers the Goods.

One man is afraid that he'll labor too hard--the world isn't yearning for such;
and one man is always alert, on his guard, lest he put in a minute too much;
and one has a grouch or a temper that's bad, and one is a creature of moods;
so it's hey for the joyous and rollicking lad--for the One Who Delivers the Goods!

There are hundreds of objects and concepts and functions that each have a name.

<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">March 30, 2011 — </span>Railay is a tiny little beach town in Southern Thailand famous for its rock climbing. I've been in Railay for two weeks. When the weather is good, I'm outside rock climbing. When the weather is bad, I'm inside programming. So naturally I've found myself comparing the two. Specifically I've been thinking about what I can take away from my rock climbing experience and apply to my programming education.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Here's what I've come up with.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">1. <strong>You should always be pushing yourself.</strong> Each day spent climbing I've made it to a slightly higher level than the previous day. The lazy part of me has then wanted to just spend one day enjoying this new level without pushing myself further. Luckily I've had a great climbing partner who's refused that and has forced me to reach for the next level each day. In both rock climbing and programming you should always be reaching for that new level. It's not easy, you have to risk a fall to reach a new height, but it's necessary if you want to become good. In programming, just like in climbing, you should be tagging along with the climbers at levels above you. That's how you get great. Of course, don't forget to enjoy the moment too.</p><a class="scrollContinueReadingLink" href="what-can-a-programmer-learn-from-rock-climbing.html">Continue reading...</a></div>

<li >Be a big fish in a small circle.</li>
<li >Spend time outside your circle, but expand it slowly. Definitely work hard to improve your skill set but don't overreach.

Even if you are a genius and can invent amazing things, by raising a few good kids their output combined can easily top yours. Nerdy version: you are a single core cpu and can't match the output of a multicore machine.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I'm not saying I want to have kids anytime soon. I'm just realizing after spending time with my family over on Cape Cod, that even my dad, who is a harder worker than anyone I've ever met and has made a profound impact with his work, can't compete with the output of 4 people (and their potential offspring), even if they each work only 1/3 as hard, which is probably around what we each do. It's simple math.</p>
