I was walking in the woods and saw a path on my right. I had never seen this path before.

It was a few feet wide and a foot or two taller than me.

Branches on both sides had been pulled back and up, forming a pointed tunnel through the dense forest.

On the ground, covering up the forest dirt was book after book, like someone had tiled a bathroom floor.

Curious, I started down the path.

*

The book path was flat like a road. It was easy to walk on.

At first it was a patchwork of hardcover and paperback.

Then at points I found myself walking on magazines. Then newspapers. Then academic journals.

Eventually I was walking on screens, flashing moving images beneath my feet.

*

At first these things were only on the ground.

But soon they started to build up in layers along the sides of the path.

Eventually I walked between walls of books and papers and screens, walling me off from the forest.

*

Finally they began to arch overhead, and soon I found myself walking in a tunnel, brightly lit by screens.

Occasionally I would spot a hole where the forest poked through. I would stop and patch the gap.

*

By now my stomach was growling.

I reached into my pocket for a peanut butter sandwich I had packed long ago.

It had been so long that the sandwich had flattened into almost nothing.

I couldn't figure out how to eat it or unflatten it, so I just pressed on.

*

I didn't notice the floor was vibrating until it was too late.

I realize now my body had sensed it. It was screaming at me to stop.

But I was in too much of a hurry to see what the next walls had to say.

*

The last thing I remember is falling through the air on my stomach as a steep rocky cliff rushed by my feet and spinning around to see a tunnel of books and papers and screens rapidly disassembling above me in front of a bright blue sky.

I saw the previous end of the tunnel went to nowhere, over a void, and the new end of the tunnel ended at the edge of the cliff, coming out of the forest full of trees rising high into the sky.
