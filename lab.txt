- *Early Access*: See new research and code early, sometimes months before publication.

- *Influence*: Vote on which ideas you think deserve the most focus.

- *Meet*: Interact with other members on the issues board.

If you are a technology investor, we have some _very_ exciting posts coming out on AI, science, and what comes after the web.

You can wait for the published versions, or you can join *brecks.lab* today.

Why sell lab access?
====================

How are independent scientists to earn a living in a world without copyright and patents?

By selling early lab access to corporations and money managers.

Independent scientists can do better science if

- They can publish everything to the public domain
- They have an empowered group of beta readers with shared interests
- They have less need to worry about revenue streams

Why not solve all three problems at once?

Labs is designed to help fix science. The public gets far better information and investors get information on what new technologies are coming next.
