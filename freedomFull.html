<p id="particle9" class="printAuthorsParser">by <a href="https://twitter.com/breckyunits">Breck Yunits</a></p>
<div class="printDateParser">April 19, 2025</div>

<p id="particle41" class="scrollParagraph">Symbols can live more than fifty times longer than humans. They require almost no energy to persist, just the occasional refresh every fifty years or so to not fade. How do we talk about this space where symbols are popping up, fading or being replicated, on surfaces and screens? I suggest a new word: <strong>Infosphere</strong>.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle45" class="scrollParagraph">The Infosphere refers to the collection of all man-made, public, persisting symbols.</p>
<p id="particle47" class="scrollParagraph">The Infosphere is not the natural part of nature. The Infosphere is not present in the woods, or on the beach, or in the mountains.</p>
<p id="particle49" class="scrollParagraph">Books, newspapers, magazines, televisions, phone screens, radios - these are the realm of the Infosphere.</p>
<p id="particle51" class="scrollParagraph">Your eyes and ears breathe the Infosphere as your lungs breathe the atmosphere.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle55" class="scrollParagraph">We depend on the atmosphere to live and we depend on the infosphere to thrive.</p>
<p id="particle57" class="scrollParagraph">A century ago in the western world new industrial technologies polluted our atmosphere.</p>
<p id="particle59" class="scrollParagraph">We largely fixed this, but now our infosphere is heavily polluted.</p>
<p id="particle61" class="scrollParagraph">Information pollution is very real.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle65" class="scrollParagraph">Earlier generations spent far more time in nature. It simply wasn't possible to be exposed to the infosphere so much.</p>
<p id="particle67" class="scrollParagraph">Now the infosphere is increasingly omnipresent, and, as it is filled with toxins, the latest generations, including mine, are the most lied to people in history.</p>
<p id="particle69" class="scrollParagraph">You wouldn't want your children to breathe toxic air, why would you want them to breathe toxic information?</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle73" class="scrollParagraph">What is the source of these toxins?</p>
<p id="particle75" class="scrollParagraph">The infosphere can nourish or poison, instruct or distract.</p>
<p id="particle77" class="scrollParagraph">You would think our laws would be designed to encourage the former and discourage the latter.</p>
<p id="particle79" class="scrollParagraph">But it is the opposite.</p>
<p id="particle81" class="scrollParagraph">The primary source of infosphere pollution are those unarchived symbols that we are not permitted to adjust.</p>
<p id="particle83" class="scrollParagraph">We have made widespread a thing called "copyright" law. What does this do?</p>
<p id="particle85" class="scrollParagraph">It orders that new symbols be frozen for over 100 years.</p>
<p id="particle87" class="scrollParagraph">It pretends that this would lead to a healthier infosphere, but any thinking man can see how clearly false this is.</p>
<p id="particle89" class="scrollParagraph">Ideas work best continually refined. Freezing is non-nonsensical.</p>
<p id="particle91" class="scrollParagraph">No honest scientist or engineer would ever say their symbols are perfect. Instead they constantly strive to correct them, iterating upon them until they die, and hoping that future generations will continue to iterate upon them after that. The scientist also publishes their work for all to see and learn from. Meanwhile, the copyrighter demands payment before one can see their work, then puts out dribble after dribble, and claims their symbols are immune from defects, and must not be altered without permission for over a century.</p>
<p id="particle93" class="scrollParagraph">Which symbols do you think are healthier for the infosphere?</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle97" class="scrollParagraph">Nature provides incentives for improving the infosphere. Copyright provides incentives for polluting the infosphere.</p>
<p id="particle99" class="scrollParagraph">Believing one can centrally set the optimal "term limits" on information is as naive as believing one can centrally set prices.</p>
<p id="particle101" class="scrollParagraph">Free markets would far more intelligently organize the infosphere.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle105" class="scrollParagraph">The information filter strips toxic information, such as orthogonal advertising, from the infosphere.</p>
<p id="particle107" class="scrollParagraph">But information filtering is made illegal by copyright law.</p>
<p id="particle109" class="scrollParagraph">As a result, toxins are incentivized and linger.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle113" class="scrollParagraph">Advertising, the mixing of undesired symbols with desired ones, is like an industrial age smoke stack spewing soot into the air.</p>
<p id="particle115" class="scrollParagraph">Advertising pollutes our infosphere.</p>
<p id="particle117" class="scrollParagraph">Honest advertising needs no captive audience or copyright protection. Thus, most in the advertising business are liars.</p>
<p id="particle119" class="scrollParagraph">Liars pay top dollar for ads. Often the purveyor of copyrighted materials tries to pretend they are in an honest business but their material is bundled with advertisements for dishonest products.</p>
<p id="particle121" class="scrollParagraph">When you see "Our business model is advertising" you should interpret as "Our business model is lying."</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle125" class="scrollParagraph">What kinds of information are we most exposed to?</p>
<p id="particle127" class="scrollParagraph">Are we exposed to high value, instructive information, or are we exposed to information trying to distract and mislead?</p>
<p id="particle129" class="scrollParagraph">I often find high quality information buried under mountains of junk. We are exposed to the information on top, while the truth seeker has to go digging.</p>
<p id="particle131" class="scrollParagraph">Sadly people are not allowed to filter the junk for others and so each one must waste their time doing so (or more commonly, give up and just accept what they are told).</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle135" class="scrollParagraph">What is the harm of a polluted infosphere?</p>
<p id="particle137" class="scrollParagraph">Significant time wasting, for one. When one man's time is wasted, everyone is worse off.</p>
<p id="particle139" class="scrollParagraph">But it does not stop there.</p>
<p id="particle141" class="scrollParagraph">We saw in 2020 people worldwide held prisoner in their homes, ordered to cover their faces, and receiving forced injections, all uninformed orders made possible by a toxic infosphere.</p>
<p id="particle143" class="scrollParagraph">There are countless Salem witch trials going on right now for conditions that don't exist; immunizations that doesn't immunize; medicines that don't heal.</p>
<p id="particle145" class="scrollParagraph">An unhealthy infosphere is as deadly as an unhealthy atmosphere.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle149" class="scrollParagraph">We have recognized that we need to take care of our atmosphere.</p>
<p id="particle151" class="scrollParagraph">Similarly, we need to take care of our infosphere.</p>

<blockquote id="particle41" class="scrollQuote">The doer alone learneth.<p id="particle0"  class="scrollParagraph" style="undefined;undefined;undefined;text-align: right;"><i>Attributed to Nietzsche</i></p></blockquote>
<p id="particle43" class="scrollParagraph">I wish I spent more time moving atoms and less time moving symbols.</p>
<p id="particle45" class="scrollParagraph">I enjoy reading and writing, but I do more of it than I'd like.</p>
<p id="particle47" class="scrollParagraph">I overinvest in symbols out of duty. A small group of us stumbled upon the truth that our <a href="freedom.html">society has gotten the law wrong on symbols</a>, and as a result the infosphere has become heavily polluted.</p>
<p id="particle49" class="scrollParagraph">In an ideal world, <a href="https://x.com/jack/status/1910829254214115681">IP law is deleted</a>, the toxins are filtered from our infosphere, symbols become far more signal than noise, and I can put more time into doing things that require more motion than the pressing of keys on the keyboard or dancing a pen across a page.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle53" class="scrollParagraph">Symbols, done right, are an extremely useful tool.</p>
<p id="particle55" class="scrollParagraph">But only so far as they can improve the models embedded in one's brain.</p>
<p id="particle57" class="scrollParagraph">The latter is the ends, the essential. The former is just a means.</p>
<p id="particle59" class="scrollParagraph">The mental model is the meal, the symbols are the kitchen. Humans don't need kitchens, but do need meals. One is absolutely essential, the other is just a means to the essential thing. Kitchens are awesome, symbols are awesome, but there is a huge difference between something essential and a tool for making the essential thing.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle63" class="scrollParagraph">The Best Symbols</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle65" class="scrollParagraph">The best symbols are those that transmit reproducible experiments that someone can do to learn highly predictive models of the world.</p>
<p id="particle67" class="scrollParagraph">It is not enough to just read the symbols, you have to do the movements to learn them. The symbols are merely a guide.</p>
<p id="particle69" class="scrollParagraph">When some symbols can lead you through some motions that then unlock in you vast new predictive powers, that is symbols at their finest. </p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle73" class="scrollParagraph">I wish I could snap my fingers and get people to see what I could see. A world with a very different infosphere. New mediums beyond books and papers and shows. Where symbolic products are published in a way to be easily accessed and shared and combined and refined and digested. An infosphere not overwhelmed with noise, not constantly trying to steal your attention. An infosphere that serves you, not tricks you.</p>
<p id="particle75" class="scrollParagraph">It is far more rewarding to make things with atoms than symbols. Atomic creations are the things to be most proud of. The symbols on the screens should help us move and produce more, rather than sit and consume more symbols.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle79" class="scrollParagraph">Years ago my smart phone broke and I did not replace it. It was a life improvement.</p>
<p id="particle81" class="scrollParagraph">My laptop is nearing 5 years old. It too may soon break. I would prefer not to replace it.</p>
<p id="particle83" class="scrollParagraph">I hope the truth will be spreading by then.</p>
<p id="particle85" class="scrollParagraph">We need far fewer symbols. We need signal, not noise.</p>

<p id="particle45" class="scrollParagraph">Symbols are useless unless consulted.</p>
<p id="particle47" class="scrollParagraph">Consulting consumes energy.</p>
<p id="particle49" class="scrollParagraph">Everyone has finite energy.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle53" class="scrollParagraph">Consulting can be sequential or—via computation—simultaneous.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle57" class="scrollParagraph">I call symbols with no legal restrictions the <strong>Unchained</strong>.</p>
<p id="particle59" class="scrollParagraph">The <strong>Unchained</strong> is too large to be consulted sequentially.</p>
<p id="particle61" class="scrollParagraph">The <strong>Unchained</strong> can be consulted computationally and so simultaneously.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle65" class="scrollParagraph">I call symbols with legal restrictions the <strong>©hained</strong>.</p>
<p id="particle67" class="scrollParagraph">The <strong>©hained</strong> is too large to be consulted sequentially.</p>
<p id="particle69" class="scrollParagraph">The <strong>©hained</strong> may not be consulted computationally and thus cannot be consulted simultaneously.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle73" class="scrollParagraph">Because the <strong>©hained</strong> may not be consulted computationally, consulting from the <strong>©hained</strong> and consulting from the <strong>Unchained</strong> are exclusive operations.</p>
<p id="particle75" class="scrollParagraph">Sequentially consulting the <strong>©hained</strong> reduces energy available for simultaneously consulting the <strong>Unchained</strong>.</p>
<p id="particle77" class="scrollParagraph">Thus, the <strong>©hainer</strong>'s implicit argument is that sequentially consulting their <strong>©hained</strong> symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting the <strong>Unchained</strong>.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle83" class="scrollParagraph">A <strong>©hainer</strong> mathematician claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting Euclid, Gauss, and Euler.</p>
<p id="particle84" class="scrollParagraph">A <strong>©hainer</strong> physicist claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein.</p>
<p id="particle85" class="scrollParagraph">A <strong>©hainer</strong> musician claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart.</p>
<p id="particle86" class="scrollParagraph">A <strong>©hainer</strong> biologist claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting Leeuwenhoek, Pasteur, and Darwin.</p>
<p id="particle87" class="scrollParagraph">A <strong>©hainer</strong> artist claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting da Vinci, Rembrandt, and van Gogh.</p>
<p id="particle88" class="scrollParagraph">A <strong>©hainer</strong> author claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting Homer, Shakespeare, and Dostoevsky.</p>
<p id="particle90" class="scrollParagraph"><strong>©hainer</strong><strong>s</strong> claim their symbols ought be treated with more consideration than the symbols of these greats.</p>
<p id="particle92" class="scrollParagraph">I hope you see why this is such a ridiculously dishonest position, and understand my visceral disgust for this behavior.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle96" class="scrollParagraph">© is the mark of the <strong>©hainer</strong>. It is the mark of the dishonest man.</p>
<p id="particle98" class="scrollParagraph">I salute and lend my hands to the honest men who contribute symbols to the great <strong>Unchained</strong>. They have an honest estimation of their humble contributions in relation to the whole. It is on their shoulders that the future is built.</p>

<p id="particle41" class="scrollParagraph">Nobody talks about how Bill Gates <em>actually</em> made his billions.</p>
<p id="particle43" class="scrollParagraph">Nobody talks about how Larry Ellison <em>actually</em> made his billions.</p>
<p id="particle45" class="scrollParagraph">Nobody talks about how Larry and Sergey <em>actually</em> made their billions.</p>
<p id="particle47" class="scrollParagraph">Nobody talks about how Jeff Bezos <em>actually</em> made his billions.</p>
<p id="particle49" class="scrollParagraph">There's a Secret.</p>
<p id="particle51" class="scrollParagraph">A Secret connecting the majority of the richest people in the world (and it's not value creation).</p>
<p id="particle53" class="scrollParagraph">The reason nobody talks about the Secret is because the people who effectively control what we talk about make their millions in the same way. Talking about the Secret is a surefire way to get kicked out of the club.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle57" class="scrollParagraph">Technology is abolutely incredible. Not just because of what it can do, but because of how hard it was to create. How much blood, sweat, and tears from tens of millions of people over thousands of years went into learning the patterns of our universe and helping evolve technologies to manipulate it.</p>
<p id="particle59" class="scrollParagraph">It is such a shame that this industry is controlled by people who use the Secret to extract rent and control the population. Who try and pretend their extraordinary wealth comes from value creation, and not the legal chains of the Secret. Who disrespect the great work of the countless brave and selfless souls who gave their time to build a better world for their descendants, only to see things locked up by these "tech titans" and their cronies in Congress and the media. Who will lead our country to ruin to protect their Secret and their wealth.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle63" class="scrollParagraph">I respect the work ethic and intelligence and leadership skills of the people above. But I don't respect their integrity.</p>
<p id="particle65" class="scrollParagraph">It makes me sad that so many young people get caught up chasing the same scale of fortunes as the people above, not realizing that "dishonesty" and the Secret is the <em>crucial</em> ingredient to their <em>extraordinary</em> "success".</p>
<p id="particle67" class="scrollParagraph">It makes me sad that so few can see the Secret.</p>
<p id="particle69" class="scrollParagraph">It's hidden by its ubiquity.</p>

<p id="particle42" class="scrollParagraph">"It's more comfortable than it looks."</p>
<p id="particle44" class="scrollParagraph">"And this just v1. By v10 it will be as lightweight as a surgical mask."</p>
<p id="particle46" class="scrollParagraph">"And how long does the gluon encoding last?"</p>
<p id="particle48" class="scrollParagraph">"Thousands of years. Once you've tagged an atom, it's yours for life."</p>
<style>.printTitleParser,.printDateParser,.printAuthorsParser {text-align: left !important;}</style>
<p id="particle54" class="scrollParagraph">"And the lives of my ancestors."</p>
<p id="particle56" class="scrollParagraph">"Royalties for generations!"</p>
<p id="particle58" class="scrollParagraph">"And how high can you get the coverage?"</p>
<p id="particle60" class="scrollParagraph">"In theory, above 99 percent. The model you're wearing now is doing 5%."</p>
<p id="particle62" class="scrollParagraph">"Incredible. So how many atoms am I claiming right now?"</p>
<p id="particle64" class="scrollParagraph">"Fifty quintillion. Every time you breathe out, the nanopores in the mask gluon-encode fifty quintillion atoms."</p>
<p id="particle66" class="scrollParagraph">"Hey, I'm working hard to make this CO2, I should get paid for it."</p>
<p id="particle68" class="scrollParagraph">"And now you will."</p>
<p id="particle70" class="scrollParagraph">"How much information in each neutron?"</p>
<p id="particle72" class="scrollParagraph">"256 bits. Enough to fit a wallet id.</p>
<p id="particle74" class="scrollParagraph">"I've been waiting years for a business like this."</p>
<p id="particle76" class="scrollParagraph">"Well we've finally built it."</p>
<p id="particle78" class="scrollParagraph">"And tagged air is safe?"</p>
<p id="particle80" class="scrollParagraph">"Scientifically proven. We conducted a rigorous 3 month controlled experiment and observed no harmful effects. Actually, our results are about to be published in Nature."</p>
<p id="particle82" class="scrollParagraph">"Brilliant. What's your go to market plan?"</p>
<p id="particle84" class="scrollParagraph">"Move fast. Create a frenzy. 'Right now 99.99% of oxygen is unowned. Tag your share, before someone else does.' We let people know there hasn't been a land grab like this since the Great Western Expansion."</p>
<p id="particle86" class="scrollParagraph">"How long until the whole atmosphere is tagged?"</p>
<p id="particle88" class="scrollParagraph">"A few decades. It will go slow at first, but once it catches on we expect people will travel to the ends of the earth to find wild neutrons."</p>
<p id="particle90" class="scrollParagraph">"And the revenue model?"</p>
<p id="particle92" class="scrollParagraph">"You get paid when someone breathes your oxygen; you pay when you breathe someone else's. We add a transaction fee on top. The mask tracks it all. We send you a statement each month."</p>
<p id="particle94" class="scrollParagraph">"So some people will turn a profit?"</p>
<p id="particle96" class="scrollParagraph">"Just a few heavy breathers, yes. We've modeled it out. Oxygen rights are reassignable, of course, so we expect most breathers will actually sell their rights to us quite early, and quite cheap."</p>
<p id="particle98" class="scrollParagraph">"So eventually we'll own all of the air?"</p>
<p id="particle100" class="scrollParagraph">"Most of it anyway. Someday we'll monetize almost every breathe. Everyone will be a subscriber, eventually. The greatest business model ever invented."</p>
<p id="particle102" class="scrollParagraph">"But once people are paying more than they're making, what's to stop them from just taking off their masks?"</p>
<p id="particle104" class="scrollParagraph">"We'll make that very hard. Huge PR campaigns. We'll promote the superiority of tagged air versus untagged air. Film, shows, books, schools especially, we'll ensure everyone is taught from an early age that tagged air is the way to go. It will be ubiquitous yet subtle."</p>
<p id="particle106" class="scrollParagraph">"You can also make it capitalism vs communism."</p>
<p id="particle108" class="scrollParagraph">"Absolutely. Shared air is a communist idea. If you're against tagged air, you're against property rights."</p>
<p id="particle110" class="scrollParagraph">"Tagged air for safety?"</p>
<p id="particle112" class="scrollParagraph">"Yes! We forecast that untagged air will increasingly be blamed for more and more incidents. We expect poisonings and other tragedies. I wouldn't be surprised if someday the only ones breathing untagged air are terrorists."</p>
<p id="particle114" class="scrollParagraph">"Is this something governments would support?"</p>
<p id="particle116" class="scrollParagraph">"A government's dream! Imagine laws requiring masks. No one can take a breathe without the government knowing about it. Total control of the air."</p>
<p id="particle118" class="scrollParagraph">"Amazing."</p>
<p id="particle120" class="scrollParagraph">"So are you in?"</p>
<p id="particle122" class="scrollParagraph">"I'll be honest, this is the best presentation I've seen in my career. I'm in. Let's talk valuation."</p>
<p id="particle124" class="scrollParagraph">"Great to have you aboard."</p>
<p id="particle126" class="scrollParagraph">"Do you mind if I keep this one?"</p>
<p id="particle128" class="scrollParagraph">"I hope you never take it off."</p>
<p id="particle130" class="scrollParagraph">"I tell everyone I'm a value-add investor."</p>
<p id="particle132" class="scrollParagraph">"You're helping build a new world."</p>
<p id="particle134" class="scrollParagraph">"Something our ancestors failed to do."</p>
<p id="particle136" class="scrollParagraph">"Here's to tagging all the air!"</p>

<p id="particle9" class="printAuthorsParser">by <a href="https://twitter.com/breckyunits">Breck Yunits</a></p>
<div class="printDateParser">February 16, 2025</div>
</div>
<p id="particle41" class="scrollParagraph">There is a job that is currently illegal in the United States, to the great detriment of our citizens. That is the job of "Information Cleaner."</p>
<p id="particle43" class="scrollParagraph">An Information Cleaner is a person who takes in all the material being published in our information atmosphere and cleanses it: they make it transformable, searchable, modifiable, accessible, free of ads and trackers, auditable, connected to other information where relevant, and so on.</p>
<p id="particle45" class="scrollParagraph">These people are not primarily focused on the production of new information, but rather on cleaning and enhancing the information that has already been produced.</p>
<p id="particle47" class="scrollParagraph">This is a hard and <em>extremely</em> important job-think of it like back propagation- and it's currently made illegal by copyright law. As a result, our information environment is as dirty and toxic as an aquarium with no filter.</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure" style="width:1024px; margin: auto;"><a href="toxic.jpg" target="_blank"  ><img src="toxic.jpg" width="1024" height="768" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p id="particle0" class="scrollParagraph">Our information environment is as dirty and toxic as an aquarium with no filter.</p></figcaption></figure>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle53" class="scrollParagraph">Clean information</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle55" class="scrollParagraph">Clean information is bits encoded as simply and noise-free as technology allows. Clean information is easy to move and to copy. Clean information is easy to search. It is easy to dice and remix. Clean information has had all toxins removed, such as ads and trackers (or at the least, it is in a form where those can be easily removed). Clean information comes with provenance information. It comes with hashed change information.</p>
<p id="particle57" class="scrollParagraph">Clean information is not Netflix. It is not Prime Video. It is not Disney Plus or Nature.com or The New York Times. All of those are <em>dirty</em> information. Information with DRM; information claiming to be "licensed"; information with a paywall; information without source code; all of this is dirty information. And Americans should be allowed to clean it up.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle61" class="scrollParagraph">The Underground Information Cleaners</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle63" class="scrollParagraph">Now some modern day heroes are clandestine Information Cleaners, building and expanding projects like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis">LibGen</a> and <a href="https://annas-archive.org/">Anna's Archive</a> and <a href="https://archive.vn/">archive.today</a>. These people are secretly keeping civilization from tumbling into a dark age.</p>
<p id="particle65" class="scrollParagraph">While they risk their lives and liberty to prevent civilization from collapsing into an information-controlled dystopia, some of us need to be proselytizing in public and making the case as to why Information Cleaning should be a root right, enshrined in the Constitution and revered at the same level as freedom of speech; freedom of the press; freedom of religion.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle69" class="scrollParagraph">Information does not lead to a better world; Clean information does</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle71" class="scrollParagraph">In the past 50 years Americans were misled to think it was the quantity of information that was the thing to optimize for. This is false. The thing to optimize for is the <em>cleanliness</em> of information. It is far better to have the infrastructure in place to clean information, rather than to produce information. It is vastly easier to produce valuable new information once you've cleaned up all existing information.</p>
<p id="particle73" class="scrollParagraph">In that sense, the way to properly incentivize the production of new information is to make legal the cleaning of old information.</p>
<p id="particle75" class="scrollParagraph">If we want to make our air clean, if we want to make our food clean, if we want to make our bodies clean, we first have to make our information clean.</p>

<p id="particle41" class="scrollParagraph">If our government is going to make laws governing information, then we should optimize for truth and signal, over lies and noise.</p>
<p id="particle43" class="scrollParagraph">The objective should not be maximizing the ability to make money off of information. Nature provides natural incentives for discovering new truths, we don't need any unnatural ones. In fact, the unnatural incentives on information production actually <a href="whyDoWeSubsidizeLies.html">incentivize lying and noise</a>, rather than truth generation.</p>
<p id="particle45" class="scrollParagraph">I'm surprised this is such a minority opinion, but very few people are with me on this (those that already are---❤️).</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle49" class="scrollParagraph">What kind of a system maximizes truth?</p>
<p id="particle51" class="scrollParagraph">Well, what is truth?</p>
<p id="particle53" class="scrollParagraph">Truth is when someone publishes a set of symbols with the claim that they accurately predict something about the world and then later sensors verify that those symbols did accurately predict it.</p>
<p id="particle55" class="scrollParagraph">These truths are extremely helpful. They give us warm buildings, useful electricity, cures for disease, lenses to see more, safe transportation, and so on.</p>
<p id="particle57" class="scrollParagraph">There are also kinds of information that might not necessarily make accurate predictions about the world but don't pretend to. Fictional stories or songs or jokes meant to amuse. These are fine and also have natural incentives (the love and admiration from your peers, for example).</p>
<p id="particle59" class="scrollParagraph">Then there are lies. These are symbols that claim to predict things about the world that don't, in fact, hold up when the sensor data comes in. Much of advertising falls in this category.</p>
<p id="particle61" class="scrollParagraph">Finally, there is also noise. Noise is often truths repackaged in extremely verbose, obfuscated, or scrambled order that wastes people's time and can mislead.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle65" class="scrollParagraph">Other than total censorship, I cannot think of a worse information policy than the one we currently have in this country, where it is not legal for someone to edit published information and republish their edited versions. Where it is illegal for someone to create a repository of maximal truth.</p>
<p id="particle67" class="scrollParagraph">We need smart people to delete all this noise, to distill all the signal, and deliver truthful, efficient information to the public. This needs to be legal, not illegal.</p>
<p id="particle69" class="scrollParagraph">Truth needs to be the thing to optimize for, not royalties.</p>
<p id="particle71" class="scrollParagraph">It's time for the <a href="ifa.html">IFA</a>.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle41" class="scrollParagraph">Why copyright and patent terms need to be 0</h1>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 id="particle43" class="scrollQuestion">How long should copyright and patent terms be?</h4>
</div>
<p id="particle45" class="scrollParagraph">There is a correct answer, and that answer is zero.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle49" class="scrollParagraph">The progress of arts and sciences depends on rapidly testing novel assemblies of ideas to see if they are good ideas or bad ideas.</p>
<p id="particle51" class="scrollParagraph">If you have a concept of copyrights and patents, then before testing any new assembly of an idea, you have to ensure you have permission to test the idea.</p>
<p id="particle53" class="scrollParagraph">The <strong>Permission Function</strong> compares your idea with all others to ensure it does not violate any copyrights or patents.</p>
<p id="particle55" class="scrollParagraph">If you run afoul of the Permission Function, you can suffer great legal consequences.</p>
<p id="particle57" class="scrollParagraph">The Permission Function take times and energy to run comparisons, communicate with "owners", and perhaps find workarounds.</p>
<p id="particle59" class="scrollParagraph">The problem is, you don't know how good an idea is until you test it!</p>
<p id="particle61" class="scrollParagraph">You often need to test 100 new ideas to find 1 <em>good</em> idea.</p>
<p id="particle63" class="scrollParagraph">Thus most of your resources are wasted on running the Permission Function on bad ideas.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h4 id="particle67" class="scrollQuestion">Why zero?</h4>
</div>
<p id="particle69" class="scrollParagraph">When you understand the colossal waste of time and energy the Permission Function introduces, you realize that even setting the term of copyrights and patents to 1 year is incredibly harmful, and slows down progress by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p id="particle71" class="scrollParagraph">When the term is 0, there is no Permission Function, and the progress of arts and sciences is unchained.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle75" class="scrollParagraph"><b>No AGI will waste energy running a Permission Function. AIs that do will be outcompeted.</b></p>
<p id="particle77" class="scrollParagraph">Similarly, to survive, humans need to abolish the Permission Function.</p>

<p id="particle41" class="scrollParagraph">If you could see everything across space and time, we would not need to read and write.</p>

<p id="particle47" class="scrollParagraph">You would not need words to learn when your grandfather decided your grandmother was the one because you could just see everything he saw.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle51" class="scrollParagraph">But we can't see everything.</p>
<p id="particle53" class="scrollParagraph">We can only see what's in front of us at this moment.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle57" class="scrollParagraph">This is not optimal for our health.</p>
<p id="particle59" class="scrollParagraph">Our Universe is mostly mystery, but at least we know there are patterns.</p>
<p id="particle61" class="scrollParagraph">And if you can learn these patterns, you can have a better time.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle65" class="scrollParagraph">To learn a pattern you first must see it.</p>
<p id="particle67" class="scrollParagraph">Our ancestors could only see with their eyes.</p>
<p id="particle69" class="scrollParagraph">Some lucky descendants evolved the ability to imagine things that weren't there.</p>
<p id="particle71" class="scrollParagraph">Language requires imagination.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle75" class="scrollParagraph">Once we could imagine, symbols could evolve.</p>
<p id="particle77" class="scrollParagraph">A discoloring on a surface.</p>
<p id="particle79" class="scrollParagraph">A mark to communicate a pattern.</p>
<p id="particle81" class="scrollParagraph">What was the first mark?</p>
<p id="particle83" class="scrollParagraph">What was the first symbol?</p>
<p id="particle85" class="scrollParagraph">Let's imagine.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle89" class="scrollParagraph">A man sees a cave.</p>
<p id="particle91" class="scrollParagraph">It is cold and getting dark.</p>
<p id="particle93" class="scrollParagraph">He approaches, but then lurches back.</p>
<p id="particle95" class="scrollParagraph">He sees a bear!</p>
<p id="particle97" class="scrollParagraph">He holds his spear and prepares for battle.</p>
<p id="particle99" class="scrollParagraph">But the bear does not move.</p>
<p id="particle101" class="scrollParagraph">He looks closely.</p>
<p id="particle103" class="scrollParagraph">It is not a bear, but simply charcoal discoloring the wall.</p>
<p id="particle105" class="scrollParagraph">He remembers the shadows his companions make around the campfire to communicate they saw a bear.</p>
<p id="particle107" class="scrollParagraph">He thinks perhaps one of them rubbed charcoal to make a permanent shadow.</p>
<p id="particle109" class="scrollParagraph">He finds a different cave.</p>
<p id="particle111" class="scrollParagraph">In the future, when he sees bears, he grabs some charcoal and repeats the symbol.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle115" class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps it was something like this that kickstarted writing.</p>
<p id="particle117" class="scrollParagraph">Pictures at first, then pictographs and eventually phonetic alphabets where infinite patterns could be composed and communicated.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle121" class="scrollParagraph">Tens of thousands of years later, here we are with huge numbers of people who spend their days drawing charcoal bears.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle125" class="scrollParagraph">Our tribe now uses writing (or at least, pretends to use writing) to set the rules.</p>
<p id="particle127" class="scrollParagraph">These include rules about writing.</p>
<p id="particle129" class="scrollParagraph">What should the rules on writing be?</p>
<p id="particle131" class="scrollParagraph">What is writing good for?</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle135" class="scrollParagraph">Is it the writer that is most important, the symbols, or the reader?</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle139" class="scrollParagraph">Writers have clear incentive to create symbols since that very first symbol: symbols save lives.</p>
<p id="particle141" class="scrollParagraph">Even if it's not your own life, or your child's life, even if it's a complete stranger's life, we have learned that a civilization of strangers cooperating peacefully create a better world for all.</p>
<p id="particle143" class="scrollParagraph">But writing goes out of date, and if the writer doesn't update their symbols, they can mislead as easily as they can lead.</p>
<p id="particle145" class="scrollParagraph">It can't be the writer that is most important.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle149" class="scrollParagraph">The symbols themselves, without humans, are literally meaningless. So it can't be the symbols that are most important.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle153" class="scrollParagraph">Thus it is clear the most important thing is that the rules around symbols should benefit the readers.</p>
<p id="particle155" class="scrollParagraph">What can we do to equip readers with the best symbols possible?</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle159" class="scrollParagraph">What if bears learned to write?</p>
<p id="particle161" class="scrollParagraph">We might not be here.</p>
<p id="particle163" class="scrollParagraph">Our ancestors might have seen an idyllic image of a cozy cave and walked right into a bear's mouth.</p>
<p id="particle165" class="scrollParagraph">Lies kill.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle169" class="scrollParagraph">Can we protect ourselves from writing bears, from lies?</p>
<p id="particle171" class="scrollParagraph">How do we make the most from symbols?</p>
<p id="particle173" class="scrollParagraph">The trick is to make symbols as honest as possible.</p>
<p id="particle175" class="scrollParagraph">And how do we do that?</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle179" class="scrollParagraph">Bears want nothing more than to outlaw writeability.</p>
<p id="particle181" class="scrollParagraph">Bears do not want you to spread the truth about their cave.</p>
<p id="particle183" class="scrollParagraph">They don't want you to know what's really inside.</p>
<p id="particle185" class="scrollParagraph">And so to do that, not only do they lie about what's inside, but they make their wall unwriteable.</p>
<p id="particle187" class="scrollParagraph">They do not allow edits. They do not allow transformations.</p>
<p id="particle189" class="scrollParagraph">Bears make symbols to serve themselves, and themselves alone.</p>
<p id="particle191" class="scrollParagraph">And by doing that, they lead people to slaughter.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle195" class="scrollParagraph">To make symbols the best for readers, symbols must always be writeable.</p>
<p id="particle197" class="scrollParagraph">All symbols should be writeable.</p>
<p id="particle199" class="scrollParagraph">Do not trust anyone who wants to restrict your rights to write.</p>

<p id="particle56" class="scrollParagraph">Patents.</p>
<p id="particle58" class="scrollParagraph">Patents they tell you are helping you are actually poisoning you.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle62" class="scrollParagraph">Some points of agreement</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle64" class="scrollParagraph">First, there are some points I think we can all agree with. Patents are awarded to novel inventions that have plausible utility. Patents encourage the publication of those inventions in some form. Patents are effective at discouraging unlicensed competitors and do create monopoly pricing power.</p>
<p id="particle66" class="scrollParagraph">I agree with all those points.</p>
<p id="particle68" class="scrollParagraph">But now let me present a new way to look at things.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle72" class="scrollParagraph">What is a patent?</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle74" class="scrollParagraph">A patent is embodied as a digital PDF. A PDF is just a long binary number.</p>
<p id="particle76" class="scrollParagraph">Thus one can accurately say a patent is a long, seemingly random number.</p>
<p id="particle78" class="scrollParagraph">The patent "owner" makes money by people paying to use that random number.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle82" class="scrollParagraph">Patents incentivize the wrong thing</h1>
</div>
<blockquote id="particle84" class="scrollQuote">Patents do not incentivize solving problems. Patents incentivize convincing people they need your random number.</blockquote>
<p id="particle86" class="scrollParagraph">If you've got a patent on a random number, you make no money if people solve their problems without your random number, but <em>monopoly money</em> if they use your random number (regardless if it actually solves their problem).</p>
<p id="particle88" class="scrollParagraph">As a result, companies are coming out with all sorts of random numbers that are great at generating monopoly profits, but terrible at solving people's problems.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle92" class="scrollParagraph">More patents, more problems</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle94" class="scrollParagraph">Even better than just making monopoly money from one random number is to make monopoly money from a suite of random numbers.</p>
<p id="particle96" class="scrollParagraph">Convince people that they need food made by your patented machines; foods that cause illnesses; illnesses which you say can only be cured by your patented medicines; medicines which cause side effects that you claim can only be cured by your other patented medicines; and your royalties will be royal!</p>
<p id="particle98" class="scrollParagraph">Of course, your inventions are only solving problems that your other inventions created, but most people don't know that and so you can go on posting your stamped US Patent Certificates on LinkedIn and boasting about what a great innovator you are.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle102" class="scrollParagraph">Patents stifle innovation</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle104" class="scrollParagraph">The worst thing that can happen to a patent holder is that someone actually figures out a solution to the problem their patent claims to solve while their patent is active.</p>
<p id="particle106" class="scrollParagraph">Thus, once someone is granted a patent, they have strong <strong>disincentive</strong> to <em>actually</em> solving someone's problems.</p>
<p id="particle108" class="scrollParagraph">You do not want to publish or even fund anything that might show that your random number does not actually work.</p>
<p id="particle110" class="scrollParagraph">You want to sit back and tell yourself "job well done" while collecting royalty checks.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle114" class="scrollParagraph">Patents incentivize addiction</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle116" class="scrollParagraph">What's even better than selling an addictive drug? Having a legal monopoly on an addictive drug!</p>
<p id="particle118" class="scrollParagraph">Patents richly reward those who can get vast numbers of people addicted to their random number.</p>
<p id="particle120" class="scrollParagraph">This is exactly what happened with Purdue and the opioid epidemic. If you look at the legal docs, you'll see that <a href="https://x.com/caseymross/status/1201848000185872385">step 1</a> in Purdue's playbook was to build an aggressive patent strategy.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle124" class="scrollParagraph">Patents incentivize censorship, information control and dishonest advertising</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle126" class="scrollParagraph">We've all seen how much big pharma advertises. Why on earth would they need to advertise their life saving medications?</p>
<p id="particle128" class="scrollParagraph">Surely no news would travel faster by word-of-mouth than life saving inventions!</p>
<p id="particle130" class="scrollParagraph">Unless of course, these medicines are not life-saving at all?</p>
<p id="particle132" class="scrollParagraph">If the life saving inventions were the unpatented ones, then the only way for businesses to profit off patents would be to convince you of a lie.</p>
<p id="particle134" class="scrollParagraph">Truth is free. Lies require advertising.</p>
<p id="particle136" class="scrollParagraph">If you have to choose between owning a business with a monopoly or owning a business in a competitive field, the former makes far more money. The only requirement is you must dedicate a portion of your proceeds to brainwashing customers that they need your random number (they don't)!</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle140" class="scrollParagraph">I don't care if you share this post, but please do share these ideas</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle142" class="scrollParagraph">I could drone on and on along these lines, but I want to keep this (reasonably) short.</p>
<p id="particle144" class="scrollParagraph">Please think about this for yourself: what do patents actually incentivize? Don't just repeat what people <em>tell you</em> they incentivize. Think about it from first principles.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle148" class="scrollParagraph">I am not in this for the money.</p>
<p id="particle150" class="scrollParagraph">I am in this for the friends that I have lost.</p>
<p id="particle152" class="scrollParagraph">Some of my best friends on this planet.</p>
<p id="particle154" class="scrollParagraph">Dead. Buried. Poisoned by patents.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle158" class="scrollParagraph">Again, don't take my word for it.</p>
<p id="particle160" class="scrollParagraph">Please think about these ideas for yourself.</p>
<p id="particle162" class="scrollParagraph">And remember that's exactly what the other side doesn't want you to do.</p>

<p id="particle63" class="scrollParagraph">I am going to double down on something that has worked for me in my programming career: open source.</p>
</div>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle67" class="scrollParagraph">Becoming a more honest programmer</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle69" class="scrollParagraph">My increasing honesty is evidenced in my code habits. I've gotten to the point where I'm writing almost exclusively open source code and data.</p>
<p id="particle71" class="scrollParagraph">It's futile to lie about open source projects. There are too many intricate details for a false narrative to account for. Not only can readers inspect and learn what a program does and how it works, but they can also inspect how it was built. The effort, time and resources it took. All the meandering wrong paths and long corrections. Who did what. The occasional times when something was done faster than promised, and the many times when forecasts were too optimistic.</p>
<p id="particle73" class="scrollParagraph">My software products are imperfect. They always seem much worse to me than I know they can be. But they are honest, and one can see I am hellbent on making them better.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle77" class="scrollParagraph">Closed sourced programs are like Instagram accounts</h1>
<p id="particle78" class="scrollParagraph">With closed source software one gets a shiny finished product without seeing any of the truth behind what it took to make. And almost always what people hide from you they will lie to you about.</p>
</div>
<p id="particle80" class="scrollParagraph">The closed source software company is like the social media influencer who posts an amazing sunset shot of them in a bathing suit swimming next to dolphins. They will make it look effortless and hide from you the truth: the hundred less glamorous photos, the dozen excursions with no dolphins, and the intense workouts and hidden costs of their lifestyle. They will hide from you all the flaws.</p>
<p id="particle82" class="scrollParagraph">On social media this probably has minor consequences but in software eventually consumers are left increasingly paying the price for dishonest software. Technical debt accumulates in closed source projects and in the long run more honest approaches turn out to be better.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle86" class="scrollParagraph">Applying the same open source strategy to the rest of my life</h1>
<p id="particle87" class="scrollParagraph">Like my software projects, I don't have my life all figured out. I'm figuring it out and improving as I go. Stupidly, besides this blog I didn't do much in the way of open sourcing my life. I'm not talking about sharing glamour shots on Instaface. Instead I'm talking about <strong>open sourcing the plumbing: financials, health, legal contracts</strong>. The things people generally don't share, at least in my region of the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle91" class="scrollParagraph">Now, I would be lying if I said I got here by choice.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle95" class="scrollParagraph">A Curse and a Blessing</h1>
<p id="particle96" class="scrollParagraph">On October 6th of last year, I showed up to my then-wife's parents' house with flowers. As the saying goes "Flowers are cheap. Divorce is expensive." Unfortunately, my wife was off in a suite with someone else, the marriage was not savable, and divorce is expensive<a href="#note2" class="scrollNoteLink" id="noteUsage2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>
</div>
<p id="particle98" class="scrollParagraph">I thought my marriage was an edifice that would last forever. Instead it crumbled as quickly as an unstable building in an earthquake. In the rubble I found a gem: I now give zero fucks.</p>
<p id="particle100" class="scrollParagraph">I am an 89 year old man in a 39 year old's body. I am not afraid of divorce. I am not afraid of public embarrassment. I am not afraid of financial ruin. I am not afraid of dishonest judges. I am not afraid of war. I am not afraid of death. I am now <a href="evie.jpg">bald Evie from V for Vendetta</a> except with a penis and far, far less attractive.</p>
<p id="particle102" class="scrollParagraph">Things that people don't publish are the things they lie about. If I want to force myself into being extraordinarily honest, I need to take extraordinary steps. If I publish everything, then I can lie about nothing.</p>
<p id="particle104" class="scrollParagraph">I have the opportunity to open source my life. Not for attention or because I think other people will care, but because it will help me be a more honest me. I won't have to waste a second thinking about what to reveal to someone, or deciding whether to be coy. I will make it futile to lie about anything.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle108" class="scrollParagraph">A Better Life</h1>
<p id="particle109" class="scrollParagraph">In addition to keeping me honest, I see a lot of ways how open sourcing my life will have similar benefits to open sourcing my code. I can get more feedback, and collaborate with more people on new approaches to life.</p>
</div>
<p id="particle111" class="scrollParagraph">I have a lot of ideas. I want to open source my net worth, income and expenses, assets, health information, and a lot more. There's a lot of opportunity to also build new languages to do so. I'm excited for the future. Time to get to work.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle38" class="printTitleParser"><a href="safeFs.html">SafeFS</a></h1>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 id="particle41" class="scrollParagraph"><em>Or: If lawyers invented a filesystem</em></h2>
</div>
<p id="particle43" class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">January 27, 2023 — </span>Today the trade group <em>Lawyers Also Build In America</em> announced a new file system: SAFEFS. This breakthrough file system provides 4 key benefits:</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle47" class="scrollParagraph">1. Advanced obfuscation keeps jobs SAFE</h1>
<p id="particle48" class="scrollParagraph">Traditional file systems take a signal and store the 1's and 0's directly. In a pinch, a human can always look at those 1's and 0's with a key and understand the file. This robust, efficient approach is sub-optimal when it comes to job creation. By using custom hardware chips to obfuscate data on write, SafeFS creates:</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 id="particle50" class="scrollParagraph">More hardware jobs</h2>
<p id="particle51" class="scrollParagraph">These additional chips lead to an increase in employment not only in chip design and manufacturing, but also in licensing and other legal jobs.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 id="particle53" class="scrollParagraph">More energy jobs</h2>
<p id="particle54" class="scrollParagraph">The obfuscating and de-obfuscating processes increase power usage, increasing jobs in the fossil fuel and other energy industries.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 id="particle56" class="scrollParagraph">More research jobs</h2>
<p id="particle57" class="scrollParagraph">SafeFS ensures that in any catastrophe, information is lost forever, meaning much of humanity's work will need to be redone, leading to further research jobs.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle59" class="scrollParagraph">2. SAFE from competition</h1>
<p id="particle60" class="scrollParagraph">Traditional file systems make it easy to access, edit, and remix files in limitless ways. SafeFS provides a much simpler user experience by providing read-only access to files. Which apps are granted read-only access can also be controlled, further simplifying the user experience.</p>
</div>
<p id="particle62" class="scrollParagraph">In addition to the user experience benefits, this also ensures that businesses producing files are SAFE from increased competition.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle64" class="scrollParagraph">3. SAFE from costly bugs</h1>
<p id="particle65" class="scrollParagraph">Software bugs traditionally cost businesses money. SafeFS flips that— turning what once were expensive bugs into lucrative revenue streams. SafeFS prevents consumers from making their own backups or sharing the files they purchased. Anytime they experience a bug that prevents them from accessing their purchased files they have no choice but to buy them again. In addition, businesses can use SAFEFS's remote bricking capabilities intentionally or unintentionally to keep revenue streams SAFE.</p>
</div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle67" class="scrollParagraph">4. SAFE from economic growth</h1>
<p id="particle68" class="scrollParagraph">SafeFS is the first file system proven to cause a slowdown in economic growth. SafeFS will cause countless hours of productive time to be wasted across all classes of builders: engineers, architects, scientists, construction workers, drivers, service workers, et cetera, ensuring progress does not go so fast that technology eliminates the need for lawyers, keeping legal jobs SAFE.</p>

<p id="particle42" class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">October 4, 2022 — </span>Every second your body makes 2.83 million new cells. If you studied <em>just one</em> of those cells from a single human—sequencing all the DNA, RNA, and proteins, you would generate more data than can fit in Google, Microsoft, and Amazon's datacenters combined. <strong>Cancer is an information problem</strong>.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle46" class="scrollParagraph">Mitosis refers to the process where a cell splits and takes about 2 hours. If you were building a startup and it was the fastest startup ever and your team doubled in size every month, you would be going at 0.0028 the speed of mitosis. <strong>Mitosis is very very fast</strong>.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle52" class="scrollParagraph">We think our information tools have gotten fast because we compare them to our old tools, but when we compare them to the challenge of mitosis and cancer they are <strong>slower than molasses</strong>.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle56" class="scrollParagraph">Copyright laws are <a href="an-unpopular-phrase.html">intellectual slavery</a>, and slow down our cancer researchers and healthcare workers to crawling speed. <strong>Because of our expanding copyright laws, our information tools are far too slow and as a result our cancer survival rates haven't budged in a century</strong>.</p>
<p id="particle58" class="scrollParagraph">Bad ideas survive <strong>far</strong> too long before <a href="eta.html">evolving into good ideas</a> in an information environment with copyright.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle62" class="scrollParagraph">We can either cure cancer or have copyright laws. We cannot do both. Mitosis is too fast and <strong>we need our information tools to be much, much <a href="how-the-public-domain-can-win.html">faster</a></strong>. We need them to be <a href="orders-of-magnitude.html">orders of magnitude</a> faster.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle66" class="scrollParagraph">I can confidently make a prediction: <strong>if we pass an <a href="ifa.html">amendment</a> ending copyright laws, we will see cancer fatality rates in the United States plummet by 50% within 2 years</strong>. I am willing to bet my <span class="scrollHoverNote" title="I am a bad bettor because I'm often wrong on timing—so let me be clear by "my entire net worth" I only refer to 50% of our family's assets—if I were to lose the bet I hope my wife will be my sugarmama.">entire net worth</span> on this.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle70" class="scrollParagraph">Finally, a grim reality: though we will save hundreds of lives a day if we abolish copyright and build faster information tools, it will still take a far larger more Herculean effort to solve the toughest types of cancer.

If enough capable people start building public domain products we can change the world.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle45" class="scrollParagraph">It took me 18 years to figure this out. In 2004 I did what you would now call "first principles thinking" about copyright law. Even a dumb 20 year old college kid can deduce it's a <span class="scrollHoverNote" title="It retards the progress of arts and science, creates distrust, and increases inequality.">bad system</span> and unethical. <em>I have to tell people so we can fix this</em>.

<div class="scrollSection"><h2 id="particle49" class="scrollParagraph">Trust</h2>
<p id="particle50" class="scrollParagraph">You cannot trust non public domain information products. You can only make do.</p>
</div>
<p id="particle52" class="scrollParagraph">By definition, non public domain information products have a hidden agenda. The company or person embeds their interests into the symbols, and you are not free to change those embeddings.</p>
<p id="particle54" class="scrollParagraph">People who promote these products don't care if you spend your time with the right ideas. They want you to spend your time with THEIR version of the ideas. They will take the good ideas of someone like Aristotle and repackage them in their words (in a worse version), and try to manipulate you to spend time with THEIR version.</p>
<p id="particle56" class="scrollParagraph">They would rather you waste your time with their enchained versions, then have you access the superior liberated forms.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 id="particle58" class="scrollParagraph">Speed</h2>
<p id="particle59" class="scrollParagraph">Public domain products are <em>strictly</em> faster to use than non public domain products.</p>
</div>
<p id="particle61" class="scrollParagraph">Not just faster, orders of magnitude faster.</p>
<p id="particle63" class="scrollParagraph">You can prove this yourself:</p>
<ol  start="1."><li id="particle65" >Pick any non public domain product.</li>
<li id="particle66" >Enumerate every possible way you might use that product.</li>
<li id="particle67" >Make time estimates for each task.</li>
<li id="particle68" >Now pretend the author just announced the product is now public domain.</li>
<li id="particle69" >Enumerate over your list again, again estimating the time it would take you to do each task.</li></ol>
<p id="particle71" class="scrollParagraph">For some tasks that time estimate won't change, for many it will drop from hours to <em>instant</em>.</p>
<p id="particle73" class="scrollParagraph">For some it might drop from <em>decades</em> to instant.</p>
<p id="particle75" class="scrollParagraph">For example, say the product is a newspaper article about some new government bill and your task is updating it with links to the actual bill on your government's website and then sharing that with friends—that task goes from something that may take <em>months</em> (getting permissions) to <em>instant</em>.</p>
<p id="particle77" class="scrollParagraph">When you sum the time savings across all possible use cases of all possible products, you'll see the <em>orders of magnitude</em> speed up caused by public domain products.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h2 id="particle79" class="scrollParagraph">Cost to build</h2>
<p id="particle80" class="scrollParagraph">Public domain products are far cheaper to build than non public domain products.</p>
</div>
<p id="particle82" class="scrollParagraph">Failure to embrace the public domain increases the cost to build any information product by at least an order of magnitude.</p>
<p id="particle84" class="scrollParagraph">This is because not only are most tasks a builder has to do sped up as explained above, but also because building for the public domain means you can immediately <em>build less</em>. For example, you don't have to spend a <em>single moment</em> investing in infrastructure to prevent your source code from leaking.</p>
<p id="particle86" class="scrollParagraph">Time and resources you are currently wasting on worthless tasks can be reallocated to building the parts of your product that matter.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle90" class="scrollParagraph">To reiterate</h1>
<p id="particle91" class="scrollParagraph">You get to <em>do less</em>, <em>move faster</em>, and your products will be better and <em>trusted more</em>.</p>

<p id="particle93" class="scrollParagraph">I can't believe it took me so long to realize the overwhelming superiority of public domain products.</p>

<p id="particle53" class="scrollParagraph">The below proposal is 34 words.</p>
<blockquote class="scrollQuote">Section 1. Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of this Constitution is hereby repealed.
Section 2. Congress shall make no law granting monopolies on ideas, knowledge, or inventions, or prohibiting the free use thereof.</blockquote>

<p id="particle63" class="scrollParagraph">I am not 100% certain that if we abolished copyright and patent systems the world would be a better place.</p>
<p id="particle65" class="scrollParagraph">It would be intellectually dishonest of me to say that. I am always open to intelligent experiments that would show otherwise.</p>
<p id="particle67" class="scrollParagraph">But at this point I am <em>99% confident</em> it would be the single most massive positive improvement we can make in our world, based on <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399/">empirical evidence</a> and <a href="eta.html">theoretical math</a>.</p>
<p id="particle69" class="scrollParagraph">It would take a lot of thought to do it right, but I know we could pull the transition off without as much disruption as people fear.</p>
<p id="particle71" class="scrollParagraph">The bigger problem is this debate is not being had.</p>
<p id="particle73" class="scrollParagraph">The problem is our side needs a better starting position.</p>
<p id="particle75" class="scrollParagraph">When the debate is on details like what is the ideal length of monopolies, or when illogical terms like "Intellectual Property" are used, you've already conceded too much, and are giving up your strongest weapon: truth.</p>
<p id="particle77" class="scrollParagraph">A stronger and more logical place to have the debate is upstream of that: debate whether we should have these systems at all.</p>

</div>
<p id="particle40" class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">February 21, 2020 — </span>One of the most <em>un</em>popular phrases I use is the phrase "Intellectual Slavery Laws".</p>
<p id="particle42" class="scrollParagraph">I think perhaps the best term for copyright and patent laws is "Intellectual Monopoly Laws". When called by that name, it is obvious that there should be careful scrutiny of these kinds of laws.</p>
<p id="particle44" class="scrollParagraph">However, the industry insists on using the false term "Intellectual Property Laws."</p>
<p id="particle46" class="scrollParagraph">Instead of wasting my breath trying to pull them away from the property analogy, lately I've leaned into it and completed the analogy for them. So let me explain "Intellectual Slavery Laws".</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle50" class="scrollParagraph">Intellectual Slavery Laws</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle52" class="scrollParagraph">As far as I can figure, you cannot have Property Rights and "Intellectual Property" rights. Having both is logically inconsistent. My computer is my property. However, by law there are billions of peaceful things I cannot do on my computer. Therefore, my computer is not my property.</p>
<p id="particle54" class="scrollParagraph">Unless of course, the argument is that my computer is my property, but some copyright and patent holders have property rights over <em>me</em>, so their property rights allow them to restrict my freedom. I still get rights over my property. But other people get rights over me. Property Rights and Intellectual Slavery Laws can logically co-exist! Logical inconsistency solved!</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle58" class="scrollParagraph">The First Step to Having a Logical Debate</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle60" class="scrollParagraph">We can have a logical debate about whether we should have an Intellectual Slavery System, Intellectual Slavery Laws, Intellectual Slavery Law Schools, Intellectual Slavery Lawyers, etc. But we cannot have a <em>logical</em> debate about Intellectual Property Laws. Because the term itself is not logical.</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<p id="particle64" class="scrollParagraph">I know, having now used this term with a hundred different people, that this is a not a popular thing to say. But I think someone needs to say it. Do we really think we are going to be an interplanetary species and solve the world's biggest challenges if we keep 99+% of the population in intellectual chains?</p>
<div class="abstractDinkusParser"><span>*</span></div>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle68" class="scrollParagraph">Errata</h1>
<ul ><li id="particle69" >"They are stealing my IP." What would your "IP" be if you weren't "stealing" inventions like words, the alphabet, numbers, rules of physics, etc, that were developed and passed down over thousands of years?</li>
<li id="particle70" >"But shouldn't creators be paid for their work?" Yes. Pay them upon delivery. No need for monopolies. Does a janitor, after cleaning a room, get to charge everyone who enters a royalty for 100 years?</li>
<li id="particle71" >"Not a big deal—rights expire after a certain time." The fact that Copyrights and Patents expire on an arbitrary date is more proof that these should not be called property rights.</li>
<li id="particle72" >"This is not an urgent problem." I think Intellectual Slavery Laws have deep, direct connections to major problems of our time including healthcare, education, and inequality problems.</li>
<li id="particle73" >"This is anti-capitalist." This is pro-property rights.</li>
<li id="particle74" >"What about trademarks?" Centralized naming registries like Trademarks are fine, as long as anyone can start a registry. Posing as someone else isn't an IP violation, it is fraud. Already consequences for that.</li>
<li id="particle75" >"If you think the U.S. is bad, go visit China." I acknowledge that we have tremendous intellectual freedoms in the U.S., especially compared to other countries. I don't take freedom of speech and freedom of press for granted. However, I believe we are capping ourselves greatly by not legalizing full intellectual freedom.</li>
<li id="particle76" >"This is offensive to people suffering from physical slavery or its lingering effects." The people who would benefit the most from abolishing Intellectual Slavery laws are the same people who have suffered the most from physical slavery systems.</li>
<li id="particle77" >"I am an Intellectual Property lawyer and this offends me." The phrase "Intellectual Property" offends me.</li>
<li id="particle78" >"What about Trade Secrets?" Trade secrets and private information are fine. No one should be forced to publish anything. But once you publish something, let it thrive.</li>
<li id="particle79" >"Can't we just copyleft our way to the promised land?" Perhaps, but why lie about the system in the meanwhile?</li>
<li id="particle80" >One difference between Physical Slavery and Intellectual Slavery is in the latter it is slavery from a million masters.</li>

</div>
<p id="particle59" class="scrollParagraph">Data errors are so pervasive that I came up with a hypothesis today and put it to the test. My hypothesis was this: <strong>100% of "reputable" publications will have at least one data error on their front page</strong>.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle61" class="scrollParagraph">Method</h1>
<p id="particle62" class="scrollParagraph">I wrote down 10 reputable sources off the top of my head: the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/">WSJ</a>, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/">The New England Journal of Medicine</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/">Nature</a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a>, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a>, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera</a>, <a href="https://hbr.org/">Harvard Business Review</a>, <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News: Science</a>, the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/home">FDA</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">NIH</a>.</p>
</div>
<p id="particle64" class="scrollParagraph">For each source, I went to their website and took a single screenshot of their homepage, above the fold, and skimmed their top stories for data errors.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle66" class="scrollParagraph">Results</h1>
</div>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure" style="width:1185px; margin: auto;"><a href="dataErrorPandemic.jpg" target="_blank"  ><img src="dataErrorPandemic.jpg" width="1185" height="1200" loading="lazy"></a></figure>
<p id="particle70" class="scrollParagraph">In the screenshots above, you can see that 10/10 of these publications had data errors front and center.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle72" class="scrollParagraph">Breaking Down These Errors</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle74" class="scrollParagraph">Data errors in English fall into common categories. My working definition provides three: a lack of dataset and/or definitions, a bad reduction, or a lack of integrated context. There could be more, this experiment is just a starting point where I'm naming some of the common patterns I see.</p>
<p id="particle76" class="scrollParagraph">The top article in the WSJ begins with "Tensions Rise in the Middle East". There are at least 2 data errors here. First is the <strong>Lack of Dataset</strong> error. Simply put: you need a dataset to make a statement like that. There is no longitudinal dataset in that article on tensions in the Middle East. There is also a <strong>Lack of Definitions</strong>. Sometimes you can not yet have a dataset but at least define what a dataset would be that could back your assertions. In this case we have neither a dataset nor a definition of what some sort of "Tensions" dataset would look like.</p>
<p id="particle78" class="scrollParagraph">In the New England Journal of Medicine, the lead figure shows "excessive alcohol consumption is associated with atrial fibrillation" between 2 groups. One group had 0 drinks over a 6 month period and the other group had over 250 drinks (10+ per week). There was a small impact on atrial fibrillation. This is a classic <strong>Lack of Integrated Context</strong> data error. If you were running a lightbulb factory and found soaking lightbulbs in alcohol made them last longer, that might be an important observation. But humans are not as disposable, and health studies must always include <strong>integrated context</strong> to explore whether there is something of significance. Having one group make any sort of similar drastic lifestyle change will likely have some impact on any measurement. A good rule of thumb is anything you read that includes p-values to explain why it is significant is not significant.</p>
<p id="particle80" class="scrollParagraph">In Nature we see the line "world's growing water shortage". This is a <strong>Bad Reduction</strong>, another very common data error. While certain areas have a water shortage, other areas have a surplus. Any time you see a broad diverse things grouped into one term, or "averages", or "medians", it's usually a data error. You always need access to the data, and you'll often see a more complex distribution that would prevent broad true statements like those.</p>
<p id="particle82" class="scrollParagraph">In The Economist the lead story talks about an action that "will have profound consequences for the region". Again we have the <strong>Lack of Definitions</strong> error. We also have a <strong>Forecast without a Dataset</strong> error. There's nothing wrong with making a forecast--creating a hypothetical dataset of observations about the future--but one needs to actually create and publish that dataset and not just a vague unfalsifiable statement.</p>
<p id="particle84" class="scrollParagraph">The New Yorker lead paragraph claims an event "was the most provocative U.S. act since...". I'll save you the suspense: the article did not include a thorough dataset of such historical acts with a defined measurement of provocative. Another <strong>Lack of Dataset</strong> error.</p>
<p id="particle86" class="scrollParagraph">In Al Jazeera we see "Iran is transformed" and also a <strong>Bad Reduction</strong>, <strong>Lack of Dataset</strong> and <strong>Lack of Definition</strong> errors.</p>
<p id="particle88" class="scrollParagraph">Harvard Business Review has a lead article about the Post-Holiday funk. In that article the phrase "research...suggests" is often a dead giveaway for a <strong>Hidden Data</strong> error, where the data is behind a paywall and even then often inscrutable. Anytime someone says "studies/researchers/experts" it is a data error.  We all know the earth revolves around the sun because we can all see the data for ourselves. Don't trust any data you don't have access to.</p>
<p id="particle90" class="scrollParagraph">Google News has a link to an interesting article on the invention of a new type of color changing fiber, but the article goes beyond the matter at hand to make the claim: "What Exactly Makes One Knot Better Than Another Has Not Been Well-Understood – Until Now". There is a <strong>Lack of Dataset</strong> error for meta claims about the <em>knowledge of knot models</em>.</p>
<p id="particle92" class="scrollParagraph">The FDA's lead article is on the Flu and begins with the words "Most viral respiratory infections...", then proceeds for many paragraphs with zero datasets. There is an overall huge <strong>Lack of Datasets</strong> in that article. There's also a <strong>Lack of Monitoring</strong>. Manufacturing facilities are a controlled, static environment. In uncontrolled, heterogeneous environments like human health, things are always changing, and to make ongoing claims without having infrastructure in place to monitor and adjust to changing data is a data error.</p>
<p id="particle94" class="scrollParagraph">The NIH has an article on how increased exercise may be linked to reduced cancer risk. This is actually an informative article with 42 links to many studies with lots of datasets, however the huge data error here is <strong>Lack of Integration</strong>. It is very commendable to do the grunt work and gather the data to make a case, but simply linking to static PDFs is not enough—they must be integrated. Not only does that make it much more useful, but if you've never tried to integrate them, you have no idea if the pieces actually will fit together to support your claims.</p>
<p id="particle96" class="scrollParagraph">While my experiment didn't touch books or essays, I'm quite confident the hypothesis will hold in those realms as well. If I flipped through some "reputable" books or essayist collections I'm 99.9% confident you'd see the same classes of errors. This site is no exception.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle98" class="scrollParagraph">The Problem is Language Tools</h1>
<p id="particle99" class="scrollParagraph">I don't think anyone's to blame for the proliferation of data errors. I think it's still relatively recent that we've harnessed the power of data in specialized domains, and no one has yet invented ways to easily and fluently incorporate true data into our human languages.</p>
</div>
<p id="particle101" class="scrollParagraph"><span class="dataError">Human languages have absorbed a number of sublanguages over thousands of years</span> that have made it easier to communicate with ease in a more precise way. The base 10 number system  (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) is one example that made it a lot easier to utilize arithmetic.</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle103" class="scrollParagraph">Taking Inspiration from Programming Language Design</h1>
<p id="particle104" class="scrollParagraph">Domains with low tolerance for data errors, <span class="dataError">like aeronautical engineering or computer chip design</span>, are heavily reliant on programming languages. I think it's worthwhile to explore the world of programming language design for ideas that might inspire improvements to our everyday human languages.</p>
</div>
<p id="particle106" class="scrollParagraph">Some quick numbers for people not familiar with the world of programming languages. <span class="dataError">Around 10,000 computer languages have been released in history (most of them in the past 70 years)</span>. <span class="dataError">About 50-100 of those have more than a million users worldwide</span> and the names of some of them may be familiar to even non-programmers such as Java, Javascript, Python, HTML or Excel.</p>
<p id="particle108" class="scrollParagraph">Not all programming languages are created equal. The designers of a language end up making <span class="dataError">thousands of decisions</span> about how their particular language works. While <span class="dataError">English has evolved with little guidance over millennia</span>, programming languages are often designed consciously by small groups and <span class="dataError">can evolve much faster</span>.</p>
<p id="particle110" class="scrollParagraph">Often the designers change a language to make it easier to do something good or harder to do something bad.</p>
<p id="particle112" class="scrollParagraph">Sometimes what is good and bad is up to the whims of the designer. Imagine I was an overly optimistic person and decided that English was too boring or pessimistic. I may invent a language without periods, where all sentences must end with an exclamation point! I'll call it Relish!</p>
<p id="particle114" class="scrollParagraph"><span class="dataError">Most of the time though, as data and experience accumulates, a rough consensus emerges</span> about what is good and bad in language design (though this too seesaws).</p>
<div class="scrollSection"><h1 id="particle116" class="scrollParagraph">Typed Checked Languages</h1>
</div>
<p id="particle118" class="scrollParagraph">One of the patterns that has <span class="dataError">emerged</span> as generally a good thing over the decades to many languages is what's called "type checking". When you are programming you often create buckets that can hold values. For example, if you were programming a function that regulated how much power a jet engine should supply, you might take into account the reading from a wind speed sensor and so create a bucket named "windSpeed".</p>
<p id="particle120" class="scrollParagraph"><span class="dataError">Some languages</span> are designed to enforce stricter logic checking of your buckets to help catch mistakes. <span class="dataError">Others</span> will try to make your program work as written. For example, if later in your jet engine program you mistakenly assigned the indoor air temperature to the "windSpeed" bucket, the parsers of some languages would alert you while you are writing the program, while with some other languages you'd discover your error in the air. The former style of languages generally do this by having "type checking".</p>
<p id="particle122" class="scrollParagraph">Type Checking of programming languages is somewhat similar to Grammar Checking of English, though it can be a lot more extensive. If you make a change in one part of the program in a typed language, the type checker can recheck the entire program to make sure everything still makes sense. This sort of thing would be very useful in a data checked language. If your underlying dataset changes and conclusions anywhere are suddenly invalid, it would be helpful to have the checker alert you.</p>
<p id="particle124" class="scrollParagraph">Perhaps lessons learned from programing language design, like Type Checking, could be useful for building the missing data checker for English.</p>

<div class="scrollSection"><h4 id="particle142" class="scrollQuestion">How Do We Reduce Data Errors?</h4>
</div>
<p id="particle144" class="scrollParagraph">If someone created a working data checker today and applied it to all of our top publications, <span class="dataError" title="Dataless Forecast">blue squigglies would be everywhere</span>.</p>
<p id="particle146" class="scrollParagraph"><span class="dataError">It is very expensive and time consuming to build datasets</span> and make data driven statements without data errors, so am I saying until we can publish content free of data errors we should stop publishing most of our content? <strong>YES</strong>! If you don't have anything true to say, perhaps it's best not to say anything at all. At the very least, I wish all the publications above had disclaimers about how laden with data errors their stories are.</p>
<p id="particle148" class="scrollParagraph">Of course I don't believe either of those are likely to happen. I think we are stuck with data errors until people have invented great new things so that it becomes a lot easier to publish material without data errors. I hope we somehow create a data checked language.</p>
<p id="particle150" class="scrollParagraph">I still don't know what that looks like, exactly. I spend half my work time attempting to create such new languages and tools and the other half searching the world to see if someone else has already solved it. I feel like I'm making decent progress on both fronts but I still have no idea whether we are months or decades away from a solution.</p>
<p id="particle152" class="scrollParagraph">While I don't know what the solution will be, I would not be surprised if the following patterns play a big role in moving us to a world where data errors are extinct:</p>
<p id="particle154" class="scrollParagraph">1. <strong>Radical increases in collaborative data projects</strong> It is very easy for a person or small group to crank out content laden with data errors. It takes small armies of people making steady contributions over a long time period to build the big datasets that can power content free of data errors.</p>
<p id="particle156" class="scrollParagraph">2. <strong>Widespread improvements in data usability</strong>. <span class="dataError">Lots of people and organizations have moved in the past decade to make more of their data open</span>. However, it generally <span class="dataError">takes hours</span> to become fluent with one dataset, and there are <span class="dataError">millions</span> of them out there. Imagine if it took you hours to ramp on a single English word. That's the state of data usability right now. We need widespread improvements here to make integrated contexts easier.</p>
<p id="particle158" class="scrollParagraph">3. <strong>Stop subsidizing content laden with data errors</strong>. We grant monopolies on information and so there's even more incentive to create stories laden with data errors—because there are more ways to lie than to tell the truth. We should revisit intellectual monopoly laws.</p>
<p id="particle160" class="scrollParagraph">4. <strong>Novel innovations in language</strong>. Throughout history novel new sublanguages have enhanced our cognitive abilities. Things like geometry, Hindu-Arabic numerals, calculus, binary notation, etc. I hope some innovators will create very novel data sublanguages that make it much easier to communicate with data and reduce data errors.</p>
<p id="particle162" class="scrollParagraph">Have you invented a data checked language, or are working on one? If so, please get in touch.</p>
