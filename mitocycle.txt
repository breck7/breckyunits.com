Your body has approximately:
============================
30,000,000,000,000 Cells
========================
_and_
=====
30,000,000,000,000,000 Mitochondria!!!
======================================

*

So yeah, mitochondria are very important.

*

Everything goes in cycles.

So it surprises me there's not yet a word "mitocycle".

*

Mitochondria were first seen with optical microscopes in the late 1800's.

In the 1950's  electron microscopes gave us our first good look at them.

*

Now we know that they are _extremely_ important for health.

And that a lot of modern foods and lifestyles have proved harmful to them.

*

When will we have mitometers?

What is the optimal population?

Are your mitos high right now, or low?

Are they wiggling fast or slow?

What are their natural cycles?

I believe the term "mitocycle", will be important in the future.

It's been 134 years since the first published drawings of mitochondria
