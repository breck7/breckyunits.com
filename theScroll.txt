I'm going to show you

that is...

small

*

But in 10 years...

this thing may be BIG.

*

REALLY BIG

*

How big?

As big as...

*

THE WEB

This thing is called

THE SCROLL

A non-toxic, intelligent, trustworthy successor to the web that works offline.

*

It's a language

It's a library

It's a liberation

*

Scroll is a language

PPS: Particles. Parsers. Scroll.

$P = {T^{C^{R^I}}}$

*

Scroll is a library

${I} = \frac{\text{C}}{\text{S}}$

*

Scroll is a liberation

#buildPublicDomain

$\text{E} = \text{T}/ \text{A}!$
