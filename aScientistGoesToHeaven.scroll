 // ChatGPT/DALLE made with a little editing in "Preview" by me.
 // In this single pane comic, xkcd illustration, 3 figures are seen standing outside the gates of heaven. Another stick figure, representing God, stands next to the gate. God is in control of the gate, preventing the others from entering. Heaven is on the other side of the gate

Newton, Darwin, and a modern-day scientist go to heaven.

***

God is at the gate.

"Your research shall determine whether you may enter."

***

Newton goes first.

He hands over _Principia_.

God reads Newton's description of gravity and smiles.

He waves him through.

***

Darwin goes next.

He hands over _Origin of Species_.

God scans it. "Bingo! You're in."

***

Finally, our modern-day scientist is up.

God asks for his work.

"Sorry", he says.

"It's paywalled."
