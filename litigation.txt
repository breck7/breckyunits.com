Discourage litigation.

Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can.

Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser---in fees, expenses, and waste of time.

As a peacemaker the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man.

There will still be business enough.

Never stir up litigation.

A worse man can scarcely be found than one who does this.

- Abraham Lincoln (1850)
