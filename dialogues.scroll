 hey. I just added Dialogues to Scrolldown.
 cool. But what's Scrolldown?
 Scrolldown is a new alternative to Markdown that is easier to extend.
 how is it easier to extend?
 because it's a tree language and tree languages are highly composable. for example, adding dialogues was a simple append of 11 lines of grammar code and 16 lines of CSS.
 okay, how do I use this new feature?
 the source is below!
