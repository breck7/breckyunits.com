Imagine a waitress that drops off your food then immediately puts on noise cancelling headphones, turns and walks away. That's the experience a `noreply` email address provides. Let's make email human again! If a human can't read and reply to emails it's not too hard to setup scripts that can at least do _something_ for the customer.

# Specific examples
My claim is that no reply email address are always sub-optimal. Here are some examples, showing how in every case you can deliver a better customer experience without the noreply email. A great opportunity to get customer feedback!

? My bank (Bank of Ireland) sends automated bi-monthly statements using noreply@boi.com
Bank of Ireland could instead end each email with a question such as "Anything we can do better? Let us know!" or "If you have any issues you need help with reply to start a new case!"

? I follow many profiles on LinkedIn which sends me an occasional email on activities and updates that I might have missed using notifications-noreply@linkedin.com
Could be even as simple as `replyWithAnythingToUnsubscribe@linkedin.com`. Any replies will cause the account to stop receiving such notices.

? GitHub sends me occasional emails about 3rd-party apps that have been granted access to my account using noreply@github.com
Could be a `replyToDeauthorize@github.com` instead.

? Google Maps sends monthly updates on my car journeys via noreply-maps-timeline@google.com
Could be a `replyToStopTracking@google.com`

? Monthly newsletters to which I am subscribed via LinkedIn come in via newsletters-noreply@linkedin.com
Could be a `replyToUnsubscribe`

? e-Books available from a monthly subscription are available on noreply@thewordbooks.com
Could be a `replyToLeaveAReview`.
