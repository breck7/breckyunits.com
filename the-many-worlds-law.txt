The Many Worlds Law
===================

December 6, 2009

Imagine you are eating dinner with 9 friends and you all agree to play Credit Card Roulette. Credit Card Roulette is a game where everyone puts their credit card in a pile and the server randomly chooses one and charges the whole meal to it.

Imagine you are playing this game with your own friends. Pause for a second and picture it happening.

...

What did you see?

I bet you saw one person's card get picked and that person was sad and everyone else laughed.

Wrong!

This is _not what really happened_! In reality, despite the fact that you observed only one's person card getting picked, in reality _everyone's card got chosen_.

In reality, when you played the game, the world split into 10 paths, and every person's card got picked in one of those paths. You only observed one path, but trust me, there were 9 others.

This is a simple example of the many worlds law. You probably were not taught the many worlds law in school, which is a shame. It's one of the most important laws in the world.

Notes
=====

1. I love this game because I don't have a credit card
2. You can benefit greatly from understanding the many worlds law. Take solace in the fact that somewhere out there you won the lottery and are drinking a pina colada on your private island right now.
3. The many worlds law could very well be wrong. There could be just 1 world. There could be 42. I don't think about that much. There may be no god, but betting there is one has benefits.
4. I called it the many worlds "law" because I don't want to use the word theory or hypothesis. Theory and hypothesis are too linked in people's minds with uncertainty, and some ideas, like evolution and many worlds, have way too much supporting evidence to leave any room for uncertainty, in as much as we can be uncertain about something.
5. One of the most important laws in most worlds, anyway.
