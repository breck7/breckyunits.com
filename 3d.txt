Does 3D exist?

I just watched a great presentation from Jon Barron (of NeRF fame).

Deep neural networks can now generate video nearly indistinguishable from "real" world video and/or video generated from 3D engines.

Does this provide evidence that the 3D/4D world doesn't actually exist?

What is at the root of our conscious experience?

I can see at least 2 possible topological orderings:

```1. 4D is real
4dSpaceTime
 mind
  4dSpaceTimeModel
```

or

```2. 4D is only a mental construct
generator
 mind
  4dSpaceTimeModel
```

In the latter you are observing not a real 4D world but the generative output of some kind of network.

In (1) you have a 4d universe and light rays bounce around and hit observers who form a model of that 4d world; in (2) you don't actually have light rays or spacetime, you just generate signals to the observer's inputs and somehow we came up with the spacetime model.

When you turn your head, are you seeing new light rays or is the generator giving you simulated values?

These ideas are so far upstream they are probably unanswerable, so why think about it?

Well, I came across this talk while working on a new language for the 4D world.

If the 4D world is actually "fake", and the world is neural network generated, then that might be a waste of time.

For now I still strongly lean in favor of spacetime being real but at least I'm aware of another possibility.
