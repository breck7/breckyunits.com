Microverses

We live above 7 microverses that we cannot see no matter how hard we squint.

Each microverse is ten times larger than the one above.

Each is its own land with unique creatures, phenomena and rules.

We rely on scopes, and experiments, and symbols to map the territory.

How many concepts to describe each world? 1,000? 10,000? More?

I gave these microverses names: Hairfield, Bloodland, Mitotown, Viralworld, Proteinplace, Moleculeville, Atomboro.

And that just gets us to the atomic level. But there are many more lands beyond that we cannot see. It may be closer to the beginning than the end.
