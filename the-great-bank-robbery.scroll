* The Great Bank Robbery dwarfs all normal burglaries by
 almost 10x. In the Great Bank Robbery, the banks are
 slowly, silently, automatically taking from the poor.

* One simple law could change this:

* <i>What if it were illegal for banks to automatically
 deduct money from someone's account?</i>

* If a bank wants to charge someone a fee, that's fine, just
 require they send that someone a bill first.

* What would happen to the statistic above, if instead of
 silently and automatically taking money from people's
 accounts, banks had to work for it?
