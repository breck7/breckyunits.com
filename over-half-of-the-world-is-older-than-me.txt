Over Half of the World is Older Than Me
=======================================

July 9, 2008

It’s nice to know that more than 50% of the people  alive today have been around for longer than I have(at least for a few more years).

According to the World Factbook:
 https://web.archive.org/web/20081120163150/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html According to the World Factbook:

Median,Age
male,27.4 years
female,28.7 years (2008 est.)

World’s per capita income: $10,000 (2007 est.)...Although this distribution is a lot different than the distribution of ages, so you can’t draw the same conclusions.
