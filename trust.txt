Can you think about trust mathematically? Yes.

This makes it easier to design things to be more trustworthy.

*

You can think of anything and everything as an object that exists in 4D space.

The ideas below can be used to maximize trust of that object.

Inspection Vectors
==================

The amount you can trust an object is equivalent to the number of inspection vectors that intersect with that object.

You want to minimize the number of planes that block inspection vectors.

You want to minimize the number of complexity prisms that bend inspection vectors.

You want to maximize the number of overlapping inspection vectors of different magnitudes (aka your zoom range).

You want to maximize the time dimension of observability (version history).

You want to maximize the number of simultaneous inspection vectors.

Experimentation
===============

You want to maximize the number of copies of the object.

You want to maximize the choppability of the object.

This is my initial list of guidelines for increasing trust.
