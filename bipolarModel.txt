 The model proposed here. Mania is too much mitochondria; depression too little. We predict it is possible to detect mood state from optical images of certain cells and counting mitochondrial volume.

Mania is too much mitochondria; depression too little.

*

*Mitolevel* is mitochondrial volume divided by cell volume ($ML$ = $M/C$).

Mitolevel varies by cell type.

The mitolevels in certain cell types will be strong predictors of current system wide mood state.

Mania is elevated mitolevels and depression is depressed mitolevels.

*

Individuals who have experienced mania frequently report a feeling of quickening or acceleration, which matches this model as self-reproducing mitochondria change population exponentially over time.

Individuals who experience severe depression take a long time to recover, which matches a model where the cell is depleted of mitochondria (likely from dead mitochondria from resource exhausition during a manic episode) preventing the restoration of a healthy mitolevel.

Mitochondrial populations change much more gradually than substance levels in the bloodstream, which explains why mania is described as a "sustained high" and why depression can't be immediately "snapped out of".

Predictions
===========

1. *Abundant lab evidence.* Someone will discover a human cell type whereby one can *reliably and abundantly* predict mood-energy state of the whole person simply by measuring the mitolevels of a cell sample.

2. *At-home mitolevel tests.* Someone will organize a large number of people in different mood-energy states to contribute to a large dataset of microscopic images of mitochondria from various cell types and then, using this reference, cheap at-home tests of mitolevels using simple staining, consumer microscopes, and machine assisted counting will be developed.

3. *Millions cured*. High fat, low glucose diets will cause stabler mitolevels and radically reduce episodes of mania and severe depression

4. *A Universal Condition*. Any human being can experience mania and depression through manipulation of their diet and/or environment to force high or low mitolevels.

*

New Terms
=========

I believe eventually the phrase "bipolar disorder" will be retired, as it is a false label. I propose "hypermito" - for the state of having too much mitochondria; and "hypomito" - for the state of having too little.
