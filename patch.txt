Patch: a micro language to make pretty deep links easy
======================================================
May 27, 2024

Patch is a tiny Javascript class (1k compressed) with zero dependencies that makes pretty deep links easy.

Patch can be used with both:

- ?queryStrings
- #hashStrings

Patch handles encoding and decoding for you, and makes your deep links pretty, so you don't have to think about it.

Example
=======
This object:
{
  "countries": [
    "Canada",
    "France"
  ],
  "selection": "France"
}
Becomes `countries=Canada=France&selection=France` (and vice versa).

How to use
==========
1. Include patch.js or just copy/paste the code:

2. Give your Javascript object to Patch, and it will give you the prettiest query string it can make:

window.location.hash = new Patch(
{
  "countries": [
    "Canada",
    "France"
  ],
  "selection": "France"
}
 ).uriEncodedString

3. Give Patch a query string, and it will give you back your Javascript object:

console.log(new Patch(window.location.hash).object)

*

Specification
=============
*They key idea of Patch is to think of your query params as a spreadsheet.*

Then Patch encodes and decodes that spreadsheet.

A Patch object has 4 forms:
1. Spreadsheet Form
===================
countries	Canada	France
selection	France

2. URI form
===========
countries=Canada=France&selection=France

3. Object Form
==============
{
 "countries": ["Canada", "France"],
 "selection": ["France"],
}

4. Matrix Form
==============
[
 ["countries", "Canada", "France"],
 ["selection", "France"],
]

Delimiters
==========
Patch requires 2 delimiters, one for separating "rows" and one for separating "columns".

The default is `&` for rows and `=` for columns.

You can change these to suit your own needs.

Spaces
======
Patch encodes spaces to `+` instead of `%20` and uses the standard encoding of `+` to `%2B`.

URI Encoding
============
String inputs to the Patch constructor are assumed to be encoded and will be decoded before parsing. Similarly the string output is always encoded.

Scalar Types
============
Patch treats all scalars as strings. Do a just-in-time parse of numbers, booleans, or JSON values if needed.

Why Patch?
==========
QueryStrings can be thought of as a domain specific language for describing this structure:

type QueryStrings = Omit
Map

- QueryStrings has one very restricted string type and a simple map type.
- QueryStrings arguably adds little to no value on top of just a single string.
- QueryStrings requires you encode and decode each map pair separately.
- JSON is an alternative to Patch, except after uriEncoding JSON you lose almost all human editability in query strings.

Some benefits of Patch
======================
- Encode and decode your params just once.
- Cleanly encodes arrays and nested structures.
- Very easy to debug—it's just a patch!
