title How to fix the CDC
date 2021-03-30

aftertext
 <b>The CDC needs to
 move to Git</b>. The CDC needs to move pretty much
 <i>everything to Git</i>. And they should do it
 <b>with urgency</b>. They should make it a priority to
 never again publish anything without a link to a Git repo.
 Not just papers, but also datasets and press releases. It
 doesn't matter under what account or on what service the
 repos are republished to; what matters is that <i>every
 CDC publication needs a link to a backing Git repo</i>.

question How do you explain Git to a government leader?

paragraph
 Git is the "Global Information Tracker". It is software
 that does three things that anyone can understand 1) git
 makes lying hard 2) git makes sharing the truth easy 3) git
 makes fixing mistakes easy.

question Why does the CDC need to move to Git?

paragraph
 Because the CDC's publications are currently full of
 misrepresentations, make it very hard to share the truth,
 and are full of hard to fix mistakes. Preprints, Weekly
 Reports, FAQs, press releases, all of these things need
 links to the Gits.

question Who builds on Git?

paragraph
 The whole world now builds on Git. The CDC is far
 behind the times. Even Microsoft Windows, the biggest
 proprietary software project in the world, <a
 href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/bharry/the-largest-git-repo-on-the-planet/">now builds on Git</a>.

question What is Git?

paragraph
 GitðŸ”—en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git is an
 open source, very fast, very powerful piece of software
 originally created by <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus
 Torvalds</a> (the same guy who created Linux) that makes
 extensive use of principles from <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>.


question How can the CDC rapidly move to Git?

section Double Down on Internal Leaders

paragraph
 The <a href="https://github.com/CDCgov">CDC's GitHub
 account</a> has 169 repos and 10 people (and I'm told many
 hundreds more Git users). I would immediately promote every
 person working on these repos. (There are probably one or
 two jokers in there but who cares, it won't matter, just
 promote them all). Give them everything they need to be
 successful. Give them raises. Tell them part of their new
 job is to get everything the CDC is invovled with published
 to Git. This is probably really the only thing you need to
 do, and these people can lead it from there.

section Change Funding Requirements

paragraph
 Provide a hard deadline announcing that you will stop all
 funding for any current grant recipient, researcher, or
 company doing business of any kind who isn't putting their
 sponsored work on a publically available Git server and
 linking to it in all releases.

section Education and Training

paragraph
 The CDC has 10,600 employees, so buying them all $20 worth
 of great paper books on learning how to use Git would only
 cost $201,200. For the most part, these are highly educated
 people who are autodidacts and can probably learn enough
 with just some books and websites, but for those who learn
 better via courses or videos you can budget another $30 per
 person for those. Then budget to ensure everyone is paid
 for the time spent learning. We are still talking about far
 less than 1% of the CDC's annual budget.


question Why the urgency?

paragraph
 Because the CDC not only failed at it's mission by not
 stopping COVID, but it continues to mishandle it. Mistake
 after mistake. Miscommunication after miscommunication. I
 just shook my head looking over an amateur hour report that
 they just put out. It's sad and their number one priority
 should be to regain trust and to do that they need to focus
 on the most trustworthy tool in information today: git.

section Specific Examples

paragraph
 I'm adding two very clear and specific examples to illustrate the problem. But my sense is the problem is prolific.

subsection #1 - COVID-19 in kids vs the Flu

quote
 For young children, especially children younger than 5 years old, the risk of serious complications is higher for flu compared with COVID-19.
 - CDC

paragraph
 This statement appeared on the CDC's website for more than a year. As it should have. Every big dataset I've looked at agrees with this, from the very firstðŸ”—https://twitter.com/breckyunits/status/1228117546974371840 COVID-19 data dump in February 2020.

paragraph
 I started actively sharing and quoting that CDC pageðŸ”—https://web.archive.org/web/20210820184423/https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm in August 2021. Coincidentally or not, within days they removedðŸ”—https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm that quote. There is no record of why they made the change. In fact the updated page misleadingly states "Page last reviewed: June 7, 2021", despite the August edit*.

paragraph
 To recap, they quietly <i>reversed</i> the most critical piece of contextual advice on how parents should think about COVID-19 in relation to their children. No record, no explanation. (In case you are wondering, the data has not changed, and the latest data aligns with the original statement which they removed. Perhaps the change was made for political reasons).


subsection #2 - Changing the definition of vaccine

paragraph
 The second example is well documented elsewhereðŸ”—alexberenson.substack.com/p/a-lawsuit-in-three-acts, but the CDC changed their online definition of the word "vaccine", again perhaps for political reasons. That sort of thing seems like the kind of change that maybe should have some audit trail behind it, no?

section Conclusion

paragraph
 I used to take it for granted that we could trust the CDC. That made life easier. Health is so important but so, so complex. I would love to trust them again, and would have more confidence if they were using the best tools for trust we have.

section Notes

list
 - * Perhaps by "reviewed", they mean experts last reviewed it then, and all subsequent changes were made by an intern, on their own, which I also don't think would be a good explanation.
