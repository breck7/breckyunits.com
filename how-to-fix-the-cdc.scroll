title How to fix the CDC
date 2021-03-30

paragraph
 <b>The CDCðŸ”—www.cdc.gov/ needs to
 move to Git</b>. The CDC needs to move pretty much
 <i>everything to Git</i>. And they should do it
 <b>with urgency</b>. They should make it a priority to
 never again publish anything without a link to a Git repo.
 Not just papers, but also datasets and press releases. It
 doesn't matter under what account or on what service the
 repos are republished to; what matters is that <i>every
 CDC publication needs a link to a backing Git repo</i>.

title3 How do you explain Git to a government leader?

paragraph
 Git is the "Global Information Tracker". It is software
 that does three things that anyone can understand 1) git
 makes lying hard 2) git makes sharing the truth easy 3) git
 makes fixing mistakes easy.

title3 Why does the CDC need to move to Git?

paragraph
 Because the CDC's publications are currently full of
 misrepresentations, make it very hard to share the truth,
 and are full of hard to fix mistakes. Preprints, Weekly
 Reports, FAQs, press releases, all of these things need
 links to the Gits.

title3 Who builds on Git?

paragraph
 The whole world now builds on Git. The CDC is far
 behind the times. Even Microsoft Windows, the biggest
 proprietary software project in the world, <a
 href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/bharry/the-largest-git-repo-on-the-planet/">now builds on Git</a>.

title3 What is Git?

paragraph
 GitðŸ”—en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git is an
 open source, very fast, very powerful piece of software
 originally created by <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus
 Torvalds</a> (the same guy who created Linux) that makes
 extensive use of principles from <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain<a/> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>.


title3 How can the CDC rapidly move to Git?

title4 Double Down on Internal Leaders

paragraph
 The <a href="https://github.com/CDCgov">CDC's GitHub
 account</a> has 169 repos and 10 people (and I'm told many
 hundreds more Git users). I would immediately promote every
 person working on these repos. (There are probably one or
 two jokers in there but who cares, it won't matter, just
 promote them all). Give them everything they need to be
 successful. Give them raises. Tell them part of their new
 job is to get everything the CDC is invovled with published
 to Git. This is probably really the only thing you need to
 do, and these people can lead it from there.

title4 Change Funding Requirements

paragraph
 Provide a hard deadline announcing that you will stop all
 funding for any current grant recipient, researcher, or
 company doing business of any kind who isn't putting their
 sponsored work on a publically available Git server and
 linking to it in all releases.

title4 Education and Training

paragraph
 The CDC has 10,600 employees, so buying them all $20 worth
 of great paper books on learning how to use Git would only
 cost $201,200. For the most part, these are highly educated
 people who are autodidacts and can probably learn enough
 with just some books and websites, but for those who learn
 better via courses or videos you can budget another $30 per
 person for those. Then budget to ensure everyone is paid
 for the time spent learning. We are still talking about far
 less than 1% of the CDC's annual budget.


title3 Why the urgency?

paragraph
 Because the CDC not only failed at it's mission by not
 stopping COVID, but it continues to mishandle it. Mistake
 after mistake. Miscommunication after miscommunication. I
 just shook my head looking over an amateur hour report that
 they just put out. It's sad and their number one priority
 should be to regain trust and to do that they need to focus
 on the most trustworthy tool in information today: git.
