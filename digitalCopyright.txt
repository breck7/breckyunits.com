The law favors ChatGPT over humans

AIs may train on everything. You may not.

In America, AIs have more freedom to learn than humans. This worries me.

Do you want learn at the same library as ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or Llama?

 https://llama.meta.com/ Llama

Then you *must* become a criminal.

You have no legal option^billion.

This sounds ridiculous.

_Human made laws that work against humans?_

But it is true.

The problem is Copyright Law. Specifically, Digital Copyright.

Big corporations have the resources to legally build massive internal libraries of all the world's published information.

Their AIs can legally train on this.

Humans in America have to choose: use a criminal library, or fall behind AIs?

A Proposed Fix
==============

Some smart people want to abolish copyright on digital publications.

Among other benefits, this would ensure all Americans have the same freedom to learn as AIs.

Does Digital Copyright matter?
==============================

Of course, we may not _need_ to update the law.

- _Good_ people publish their content freely.
- Digital copyright goes against the grain of nature so much, that it has long been ignored and worked around by smart and courageous citizens, who have built these "criminal" libraries.
- AI generated content may become much better than the best human generated content. And then the entire concept of copyright will be irrelevant.

*

_But you never know._

Now might be a good time to set into law equal educational rights between humans and AIs.

While the laws are still set by humans.

Notes
=====

^billion: Well, there is no legal way for YOU to do it. A billionaire could theoretically afford to buy the "rights" and build their own library as good as a big corporation. But no billionaire is reading this post. Nevertheless, to be precise, only ~756 out of ~333,333,000 Americans ~have a legal way to train on the same materials as AIs.
