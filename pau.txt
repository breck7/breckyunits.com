PAU: Patient Accessible and Understandable health records
=========================================================

August 21, 2024

In 2019 I led some research into building next-gen medical records based on some breakthroughs in computer language design.

The underlying technology to bring this to market is finally maturing, and I expect we will see a system like PAU appear soon.

Medical records will never be the same.

Exciting times!
