		"Essay": "<nomarkdown>On linux, filenames and directories are case sensitive. <code>file</code> and <code>File</code> are different files.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, filenames are not case sensitive. <code>file</code> and <code>File</code> are the same file.\r\n\r\nMySQL saves a database to disk. A \"database\" is saved in a directory, and each table is saved as a file in that folder.\r\n\r\nThus, say you transfer a database from Linux to Windows that has a table named \"userBookmarks\", this might cause a problem for you because MySQL on Windows will likely interpret it as \"userbookmarks\".\r\n\r\nThere's a setting in your my.cnf file called \"lower_case_table_names\".\r\n\r\nThe options are 0, 1, and 2.\r\n\r\n1 is the default, and you shouldn't need to change it.\r\n\r\nIf you change it to 0 on Windows, you might run into problems. If you change it to 2, it doesn't seem to do much.\r\n\r\nSo what's the solution? Try to avoid capital letters in table names (use _ instead of camel case). When you can't do that, write your code for the Linux database (ie \"select * from userBookmarks\"), and your queries should translate fine on Windows since Windows will convert that to \"select * from userbookmarks\".\r\n\r\n\r\n"

		"Title": "The BASH Programming Language",
		"Essay": "I used to use Python, Ruby or even PHP to write backend programs that would automate things like server management tasks, development and editing tasks, deployment tasks, backup tasks, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThen I learned what is basically the BASH programming language, a language very similar to Python/Ruby/PHP etc., but is perfect for writing command line programs.\r\n\r\nHere's the core of what you need to know:\r\n\r\n<b>Use the .sh file extension</b>\r\n\r\nA BASH script should have the .sh extension, just as a Python script has the .py extension, a php script has the .php extension, and a Ruby script has the .rb extension.\r\n\r\n<b>Start your scripts with #!/bin/bash</b>\r\n\r\n> #!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nPHP scripts start with The echo statement</b>\r\n\r\nHere's your first bash script (name it hello.sh):\r\n\r\n> #!/bin/bash<br>\r\n> echo \"Hello World\"\r\n\r\nThe *echo* command prints a string and also a new line at the end.\r\n\r\n<b>Running your script</b>\r\n\r\nYour script must be **executable**. To make it executable, you need to change the <a href=\"http://breckyunits.com/code/fix_permission_problems_using_chmod\">file permissions</a>. This would make your hello.sh script executable:\r\n\r\n> chmod 777 hello.sh\r\n\r\nTo run your script, from the directory where your script is located, type this:\r\n\r\n> ./hello.sh\r\n\r\nThe \"./\" substitutes the current directory. In other words, typing\r\n\r\n> ./hello.sh\r\n\r\nis equivalent to typing the full path to the file such as this:\r\n\r\n> /home/breck/hello.sh\r\n\r\n<b>Command line Paramters</b>\r\n\r\nCommand line parameters are accessed with $1, $2, etc. Create a new script called hello2.sh. Put this in it:\r\n\r\n> #!/bin/bash\r\n> echo \"Hello World\"\r\n> echo $1\r\n> echo $2\r\n\r\nNow run your script like this:\r\n\r\n> ./hello2.sh hi breck\r\n\r\nIt should print this:\r\n\r\n> Hello World\r\n> hi\r\n> breck\r\n\r\nThe hi got stored in $1, and the breck got stored in $2.\r\n\r\n<b>Functions</b>\r\n\r\nFunctions are pretty simple and straightforward:\r\n\r\n> #!/bin/bash\r\n> echo \"Hello World\"\r\n> echo $1\r\n> echo $2\r\n> function hi_name {\r\n> echo \"hi\"\r\n> echo $1\r\n> }\r\n> hi_name $3\r\n\r\nNotice you don't need parenthesis and other junk. Name this file hello3.sh and run it with this:\r\n\r\n> ./hello2.sh hi breck conor\r\n\r\nIt should print this:\r\n\r\n> Hello World\r\n> hi\r\n> breck\r\n> hi\r\n> conor\r\n\r\nNotice what's going on with parameter passing and scope.\r\n\r\nThat's it for now. As you can see, BASH is a very clean, simple, yet powerful programming language. Get started with it slowly and gradually build up your skills with it."

		"Title": "Should your source code be in one folder or should it be nested?",
		"Essay": "<nomarkdown>There are two ways to organize source code files for a project: flat or nested.\r\n\r\nHere's a simple example of a <b>flat</b> structure(1 directory, 4 files):\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>>myproject/</i>\r\n- index.php\r\n- theme.css\r\n- helper_functions.php\r\n- logo.png\r\n</blockquote>\r\nHere's an example of a <b>nested</b> structure(4 directories, 4 files):\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>>myproject/</i>\r\n- index.php\r\n<i>> styles/</i>\r\n-- theme.css\r\n<i>> images/</i>\r\n-- logo.png\r\n<i>> helpers/</i>\r\n-- helper_functions.php\r\n</blockquote>\r\nBoth of these structures can accomplish the same thing. Which is better?\r\n\r\nIf you've worked with me on any project before, you'll know I prefer flatter structures. I try to resist adding directories as much as possible (you always have to add them eventually, but I like to fight it to minimize this effect).\r\n\r\nI don't know why my gut tells me to minimize directories, so I thought I'd write about it and see if any rationale emerged.\r\n\r\n<h2>Benefits of a Flat Structure</h2>\r\n\r\n<b>Benefit #1 - Quicker access to files</b>\r\n\r\nI primarily edit files using Notepad++ on Windows 7 or vim. If you keep all your files in 1 directory, you can open them faster (\"Control+O\", type a few letters on Win 7, or just \"vim filename\"). So, a flat structure gives you quicker access to files. I've never timed this before, but am pretty positive it works.\r\n\r\n<b>Benefit #2 - Avoid file path issues</b>\r\n\r\nDealing with paths when working with a website is often the cause of careless bugs. If everything is in one directory, it makes it painless to include things on both the server side(include 'file.php';) and the client side ('src=\"script.hs\"'). Once you start nesting directories, it's easy to make mistakes.\r\n\r\n<b>Benefit #3 - Easier to bring people up to speed</b>\r\n\r\nWhen I join an in-progress project or use a new library, I like to try and wrap my head around the whole thing. I can't do that if I have to dig into different directories to see all the files. Why hide 50% of the project in subdirectories?\r\n\r\n<b>Benefit #4 - Avoid overwriting issues</b>\r\n\r\nOccasionally you'll have a structure like this:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n- index.php\r\n<i>> admin/</i>\r\n-- index.php\r\n</blockquote>\r\nYou might accidentally overwrite one index with the other, or edit one index when you think you're editing the other. Doesn't happen too often, but occasionally it can be annoying. By sticking everything in one directory, you don't run into that problem as much.\r\n\r\n<h2>Benefits of a Nested Structure</h2>\r\n\r\nOf course there are benefits to having multiple directories, otherwise this style wouldn't be so popular.\r\n\r\n<b>Benefit #1 - Looks more organized</b>\r\n\r\nIt's nice and neat to have your files tucked away into nicely labeled directories. \r\n\r\n<b>Benefit #2 - Easier for teams</b>\r\n\r\nIt can be easier to divide work between team members when things are in different directories. For instance, why should the designers need their images mixed in with backend files?\r\n\r\n<b>Benefit #3 - A directory with too many files becomes unwieldy</b>\r\n\r\nI'll admit, once you have more than some threshold of files in a directory, it can quickly become hard to manage. If the files are nearly all of the same type (say, php files), then it's not as bad. But once you have 20 php files, 3 javascript files, 15 images, 4 css files, 2 bash files, 3 readmes, and 45 text files, it might be time to split things up.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>My theory on why directories are bad.</h2>\r\n\r\nLess paths create an easier mental model. \r\n\r\nIf you walk into a messy room, it can be hard to create a mental model of the contents of that room. This is the equivalent to a file structure like the one below:\r\n\r\n<b>Bad</b>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>>myproject/</i>\r\n- a_image.png\r\n- base_functions.php\r\n- dog.js\r\n- index.php\r\n- mike.png\r\n- names.csv\r\n- new_logo.jpg\r\n- test.php\r\n- xmlfunctions.php\r\n- zlib.js\r\n</blockquote>\r\nIt's a mess.\r\n\r\nIf you walk into a room where everything is put away(clothes in the dresser, books on a bookshelf, odds and ends in the drawers) it's easier and an improvement. A room organized like this looks like the file structure below:\r\n\r\n<b>Ok</b>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>>myproject/</i>\r\n- index.php\r\n<i>> images/</i>\r\n-- a_image.png\r\n-- mike.png\r\n-- new_logo.jpg\r\n<i>> php/</i>\r\n-- base_functions.php\r\n-- test.php\r\n-- xmlfunctions.php\r\n<i>> scripts/</i>\r\n-- dog.js\r\n-- zlib.js\r\n<i>> data/</i>\r\n-- names.csv\r\n</blockquote>\r\nBut now you've introduced the problem that to access nearly anything, you have to \"open a drawer\". You also can't see everything all at once. \r\n\r\n<b>Best</b>\r\n\r\nThe optimal solution is to not put your stuff into drawers, but to:\r\n\r\n1. Remove as much stuff as possible.\r\n2. Put the remaining stuff out in the open in neats piles in separate parts of the room.\r\n3. If, and only if, you have a ton of the same type of thing, put those into their own drawer/cabinet.\r\n\r\nIf you apply this algorithm to a sample project, you might get something like a project I just made with <a href=\"http://github.com/breck7/uno\">PHPUno</a>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>>dropdate/</i>\r\n<i>> - data/</i>\r\n-- 1\r\n-- 2\r\n-- ..\r\n-- 578\r\n- index.php\r\n- logo.png\r\n- sprites.png\r\n- style.css\r\n- uno_controller.php\r\n- uno_app.php\r\n- uno_models.php\r\n- uno_helpers.php\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Search, don't sort</h2>\r\n\r\nGmail has an adage \"search, don't sort\". I think it applies here. Directories are a form of sorting, while autocomplete(which is integrated into practically everything nowadays) is a form of searching. By sticking everything into one directory, you enable search. Create multiple directories, and you disable search.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Rule of Three</h2>\r\n\r\nHere's a simple rule of thumb to help you organize your folder structure better:\r\n\r\n- No folder in your project should have more than 3 subfolders.\r\n- There should not be more than 3 levels in any project.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the directory \"icon\" should never have a subdirectory in it. \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>>myproject/</i>\r\n<i>> images/</i>\r\n<i>>- icons/</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThis means that any project should have at most 9 subdirectories."

		"Essay": "What's the difference between a great programmer who acts cool around girls and a great programmer who does not use version control?\r\n\r\nNothing--they both don't exist!\r\n\r\nIf *every single great programmer* uses version control, why do some beginning programmers avoid it?\r\n\r\nBecause version control is made to seem intimidating. \r\n\r\nBut version control is actually very easy!\r\n\r\nIf you are new to version control, there are only 5 commands you need to memorize. Can you memorize 5 words? Of course you can.\r\n\r\nSo memorize these 5 words and you'll be practically an expert at version control:\r\n\r\n> init\r\n>\r\n> add\r\n>\r\n> status\r\n>\r\n> commit\r\n>\r\n> push\r\n\r\nIf you just start playing around with these 5 and only these 5 commands, you'll become a git master in no time. \r\n\r\nHere's a simple practice session you can follow to start getting good.\r\n\r\n### What is git?\r\n\r\nGit is a simple command line program like \"wget\" or \"vim\" that you install and use by typing commands. If you don't have git installed, try one of these commands:\r\n\r\n> yum install git-core\r\n>\r\n> apt-get install git-core\r\n>\r\n> sudo port install git-core\r\n\r\nLet's say you're creating a new website for your mom and want to use version control to do it.\r\n\r\n> mkdir moms_website\r\n>\r\n> cd moms_website\r\n>\r\n> git init\r\n\r\nThis creates a git repository. Now type:\r\n\r\n> ls -a\r\n\r\nDo you see the new \".git\" directory? That's the git repository. It's basically a folder that stores the whole history of your project. Now, when you type a git command, it will do something with the files in that folder. That's all that's really going on. You never need to go into that folder manually, I was just explaining what git is doing.\r\n\r\nNow, let's create a file and add it to your repository.\r\n\r\n> vim index.php\r\n>\r\n> Hello World\r\n>\r\n> :wq\r\n>\r\n> git status\r\n\r\nThis will show the presence of an untracked file, \"index.php\". Let's add this file.\r\n\r\n> git add index.php\r\n\r\nYou've now added the file to git, let's *commit* our changes.\r\n\r\n> git commit -m \"first commit\"\r\n\r\nNow you've made your first commit. \r\n\r\nThe last command you'll need is *push*. It works like this:\r\n\r\n> git push\r\n\r\nThat will upload your repository to an online host like github so that other people can collaborate.\r\n\r\nCreate a github account and follow the instructions for creating a new repository to test out this final command.\r\n\r\nThat's it! Those are the 5 commands you'll use over and over again. Master those and slowly you'll start learning a few other helpful git commands.\r\n\r\n#### Recap\r\n\r\n> git init\r\n>\r\n> git status\r\n>\r\n> git add *filename*\r\n>\r\n> git commit -m *\"your message about what you changed and why\"*\r\n>\r\n> git push"

Programs I run in Cygwin are noted by *. \n\nThe following is a list of the programs I use on my development machines.\n\n<h2>Daily</h2>\n\n<b>Cygwin</b>. I prefer Windows+cygwin over Macs, Fedora or Ubuntu, or Windows plus running virtualized machines.\n\n<b>Notepad++</b>. I do half my editing in Notepad++ and half in Vim. I love Notepad++'s speed, reliability, and autocomplete.\n\n<b>Dropbox</b>. Completely changed how I work. Allows me to work from multiple computers seamlessly. Allows me to share files easily with clients, family, and friends. Reinstalling Windows (which I do a few times per year), is made easy because all my important files are kept on my dropbox. The fact that install and uninstall is so easy and doesn't require a reboot really impresses me.\n\n<b>WAMP</b>. The \"AMP\" stack is what I develop for mostly. WAMP gives me an easy local testing environment to try things out before pushing to a server.\n\n<b>Chrome</b>. I spend most of my web time in Chrome. It's lighting fast. It's also simple. Tabs are done incredibly well.\n\n<b>Firefox</b>. Still need this guy. The extensions are great. Firebug and the Web Developer's Extension I use at least weekly, close to daily. It's also nice to have 2 browsers going if you want to log in to the same site with 2 different accounts.\n\n<b>Skype</b>. I don't use a cellphone, believe it or not. My Google Voice number points to my Skype In number. Skype allows me to not have a cellphone, which I greatly appreciate. My sister can call me from the Middle East just as easily and for the same price that my neighbors can call me from down the street.\n\n<b>*Vim</b>. The only Nix editor I know and love. Vim took me a while to learn, but is becoming more and more indispensable the better I get at \"typing in Vim\". \n\n<b>*Git</b>. Easy to use version control that makes sense. Paired with github, becomes indispensable.\n\n<b>*Rsync</b>. Great for deploying simple websites and for downloading backups.\n\n<b>*Grep</b>. Great when you need to track down a word or line across multiple files.\n\n<b>*Find</b>. Simple and easy for finding files. I also use find over Windows 7's search occasionally.\n\n<b>*Cron</b>. Simple and essential.\n\n<b>*SSH</b>. Of course.\n\n<b>*Ruby</b>. I keep irb running in a window when I need to do quick calculations.\n\n<h2>Weekly</h2>\n\n<b>Navicat</b>. Great way to keep an eye on databases. I also like it for creating and editing schemas. Find it easier to visualize a schema than to code it out.\n\n<b>Filezilla</b>. Occasionally when I just want to drag and drop some things from or to a server. \n\n<b>Photoshop</b>. I use an old version of Photoshop which is still way to advanced for me. But it's fast and gets the job done.\n\n<b>7zip</b>. \"Extract to here\" is a great little feature that it adds to the right click menu.\n\n<b>Word & Excel 2007</b>. Solid programs. Too bulky for my liking, but necessary in many cases.\n\n<h2>Monthly</h2>\n\n<b>Visual Studio</b>. When I get an urge to write a new desktop program. "
