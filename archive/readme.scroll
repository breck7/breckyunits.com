title My personal site archive
date 2012-02-21

paragraph
 I found it mildly interesting to dig up my old homepages and put them in this git.
 This folder contains some old sites from before 2010. This would not have been possible without the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine ❤️.

title3 August 2007

paragraph
 It looks like I registered breckyunits.com on August 24th, 2007. It appears I used Wordpress to first host my blog. Here's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070907182730/http://www.breckyunits.com/">what it looked like that September</a>. There's a Flash widget on there. The title of the site is "The Best Blog on the Internet". I think it was a good joke. I had just recently graduated college, and had not yet moved to the West Coast.

 My Wordpress blog had grown to many pages <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090713043922/http://breckyunits.com/"><a>

title3 August 2009

paragraph
 Looks like I started a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090813063739/http://breckyunits.com/">transition</a> to a new site, and moved my blog from my own server running Wordpress to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307210904/http://breck7.posterous.com/">posterous</a>.

 Here is my <a href="homepage/">homepage from 11/23/2009<a>. You can also check it out on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091103021126/http://www.breckyunits.com/">WayBack Machine</a>.

title3 December 2009

paragraph
 In December 2009 I wrote my own blog software called <a href="https://github.com/breck7/brecksblog">brecksblog</a> and here's what my new site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091204020806/http://breckyunits.com/">looked like</a>. I kept it simple, and that paid dividends as my <a href="https://breckyunits.com/">current homepage</a>, now powered by Scroll, evolved from that.
 
title3 My "Computer science" blog

paragraph
 It looks like I also maintained a programming blog from December 2009 to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531162851/http://breckyunits.com/code/">January 2012</a>. Here is that <a href="code/">blog</a> migrated to Scroll.
