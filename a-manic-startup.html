<p class="scrollParagraph"><span class="scrollDateline">June 27, 2023 — </span>I am so disappointed in myself for having yet another manic cycle and hurting the people I love. I'm sharing this to come out publicly as having bipolar disorder, take 80% blame for my actions and words, and maybe help someone avoid my mistakes.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Last August my brain lit up like fireworks. It felt like a cosmic river of energy suddenly detoured through my veins.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">My FitBit data shows a seismic event:</p>
<figure class="scrollCaptionedFigure" style="width:2374px; margin: auto;"><a href="hrAndSleep.jpg" target="_blank"  ><img src="hrAndSleep.jpg" width="2374" height="784" loading="lazy"></a><figcaption><p class="scrollParagraph">In two weeks my heart rate rose 33% and my sleep fell to 2 hours per night.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p class="dropcap">My symptoms were the typical assortment of manic activity.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I had a grand idea about a public domain computable encyclopedia to accelerate scientific research.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I started coding all hours of the night with <em>Top Gun Maverick</em> on repeat.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I started sending <em>monthly</em> investor updates <em>twice a day</em>. Here's the kicker: none of the recipients were investors.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I fearlessly pitched anyone and everyone to spread the good news about my new discoveries and to recruit a team. I wrote a letter to the President excitedly telling him about how my idea would help cure cancer.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">If I saw any data that could be interpreted as my plan working I asked no questions but immediately accepted it as clear evidence of unstoppable success.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I took no time to deeply think things through but just acted as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I poured my savings into the startup and paid a huge sum to start a direct public listing process.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I could generate a "logical" explanation for every risk I took and I took a dozen risks per hour twenty hours per day. I started writing IN ALL CAPS and explained that reducing my character set from 52 to 26 allowed me to write faster.</p>
<p class="dropcap">My family and friends and mentors tried to stop me. "Slow down." "Get some sleep." "Take some time off."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It got more intense. "Stop it." "You're sick." "You need to go to the hospital."</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I had been hypomanic a dozen times but this time I hit a new level.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">For the first time my family called the police. I calmly talked them down.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I shrugged off the criticism, knowing my loved ones would get behind me once I showed them increasingly amazing results.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Again the police were called and again I talked my way out of a hospital trip.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I was baffled that they would try to stop me because I was <em>Good</em> and was going to help cure cancer and mental health and fix science and solve all these world ills and so anyone trying to stop me was <em>Bad</em>. My euphoria started alternating with an angry "war mode" personality and I started <em>viciously</em> retaliating online against anyone who I found taking secret action against me, including my own family and close friends, which is absolutely awful, because now I realize they saw the idiotic road I was taking and were truly trying to get me to a better path, just as they said they were.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">This repelled my whole support structure and I was left on my own. I interpreted this as some grand cosmic challenge and went all in.</p>
<p class="dropcap">With my initial grand plans for the cancer database delayed, I launched all kinds of products to try and buoy the ship: I launched public domain print-at-home newspapers, programming languages, a music label, and a number of other ideas.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The estrangement with my family grew worse and worse. I felt miserable about the war with my family but believed I would eventually succeed, improve the world, and they would not only forgive me but be proud. I dreamt of the day where I'd finally hug my children again and say "We did it!"</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I told people that bipolar disorder wasn't real, instead it was "bipolar potential", and that I was not crazy but extraordinary. I would help solve the world's toughest unsolved problems. I would code and take breaks to challenge myself to do extraordinary things and learn from "extraordinary" people. Some nights I slept in the fanciest hotels in Beverly Hills and others I slept on floors in war zones. I cavorted with soldiers and spies; doctors and dancers; judges and journalists; carpenters and comedians. I visited hospitals and cancer centers; went to weddings and funerals; spent time with homeless and the .1%; went anywhere anyone told me not to go. I tried to build a support structure in months to replace the one that took me decades to build. I met lots of kind, hard working, honest people, but I don't think I ever had much of a chance of salvaging things.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">After eight months I had depleted my savings. The bets I thought would bring in millions did not pan out. Thanks to the help of many open source contributors we had done good work but my contributions were far from extraordinary. I had overpromised on my talents and greatly underdelivered.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">The root idea I still believe in mathematically and spiritually, but it's a religion, not a business.</p>
<p class="dropcap">Why did my startup fail? Me. My brain. My manic self. Someone once called me a terrible entrepreneur. I wanted more than anything to prove them wrong. That I could do this. But I couldn't. You can learn a lot about doing startups but you can't unlearn bipolar disorder.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">I desperately wanted to believe that bipolar disorder wasn't real and that I could stop living in fear of it. That all the doubters were wrong and that we would build a new kind of scientific database that would prove this.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">What pains me most is I see how crystal clear my illness was in the beginning and how I was surrounded by so much love—so, so many family and friends were desperately trying to intervene—and I spurned them and then reacted despicably. I am so, so sorry.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">Far worse than failing at the startup I failed as a husband, a father, son, brother, friend, as a kind human being.</p>
<p class="scrollParagraph">It is a hard pill to swallow that I was the Bad Guy, after all.</p>
