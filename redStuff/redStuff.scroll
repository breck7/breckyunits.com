Kaia grabbed Pemma,
on the walk home from school,
and said--"Look at that!
That looks cool!"

***

Pemma looked and saw
a sign on a door.
It said "RED STUFF,
Now sold in our store!"

***

Into the shop,
The two sisters went,
They put their money on the counter,
every last cent.

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

"One can of RED STUFF, please,"
said Kaia to the clerk.
"One can of RED STUFF," he said back
"Do you know how it works?"

***

"It says on the label"
'ATTENTION! You don't need to think
when you have got
RED STUFF ENERGY DRINK'

***

Sister and sister continued
on their way
And soon came to the playground,
where they stopped to play

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

Kaia opened the can
And brought it to her lips
Then passed it to Pemma
Who took her own sip

***

"Time to fly!" shouted Kaia
And she jumped on the swing
While Pemma ran over
to the monkey rings

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

Kaia pumped her legs
Like a good swinging flyer
She had never pumped so hard
She had never gone higher

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

And Pemma on the rings
Made it all the way across
She had tried that before
But always had lost

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

Finally they got tired
And Kaia said "That's enough"
As they walked home they said
"We love RED STUFF"

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

The next morning at breakfast
Kaia thought of a plan.
"Mom, some kids get an allowance.
Do you think we can?"

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

"Okay kids, here is the deal.
If your homework is done and your bed is made,
If your room is clean.
Do all that and you'll get paid"

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

For many days
the kids did their chores and behaved
They got their allowances
and their allowances they saved

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

Finally one day
Kaia raised both of her hands
"Pemma we now have enough,"
"FOR 10 CANS!"

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

"Ten cans of RED STUFF please"
This was quite a lot
But they had the money
So that's what they got

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

Back to the Swings
Back to the Rings
They drank the RED STUFF
And did all the things

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

Then they got tired
And sat on a tree
Drank another RED STUFF
And jumped up with glee

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

"It's my turn on the rings!"
Pemma shouted very loud
"No it's my turn"
Kaia shouted back as loud as a crowd

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

They struggled and struggled
And then Pemma ran
But Kaia followed her
Predicting her plan

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

"This is my swing!"
Pemma screamed, and grabbed one
of the chains
"No its my swing!"
Kaia screamed back, as it started to rain.

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

They tugged and they tugged
And said things to hurt
Then the chains snapped
And they fell to the dirt

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

Both started crying
Just as their mother came around
"What happend?" she asked
Then she saw the cans on the ground.

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

"Did you drink all of these?",
The kids nodded their heads.
"Uh huh. Yes we did",
They both said

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

"Well, you drank the wrong stuff
And now you can see
That wasn't very wise
What you need is GOOD ENERGY"

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

"Now its time for a bath
To take a nice soak.
And your next allowance will pay for
the swing that you broke"

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

Later that month after a healthy breakfast,
Kaia again had a plan
"Back to the playgound!"
She said, and they ran

***

image chatGPT/todo.png

On the swings Kaia swung higher than ever
And Pemma did the rings easy enough
"We don't need energy drinks Pemma."
We just need to eat The RIGHT STUFF"

***

THE END
