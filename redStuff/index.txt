Kaia grabbed Pemma,
on the walk home from school,
and said--"Look at that!
That looks cool!"

***

[Image Omitted]

Pemma looked and saw
a sign on a door.
It said "RED STUFF,
Now sold in our store!"

***

[Image Omitted]

Into the shop,
The two sisters went,
They put their money on the counter,
every last cent.

***

[Image Omitted]

"One can of RED STUFF, please,"
said Kaia to the clerk.
"Here you go.
Do you know how it works?"

***

[Image Omitted]

She looked at the label
'No need for THINKING
Just GO! GO! GO!
With Red Stuff Energy DRINKING!'

***

[Image Omitted]

The two sisters continued
on their way home
And soon came to the playground,
a fun place to roam

***

[Image Omitted]

"It's been a long walk,"
Kaia sat with a sigh.
"Maybe it's time,
To give RED STUFF a try!"

***

[Image Omitted]

Kaia opened the can
And brought it to her lips
Then passed it to Pemma
Who took her own sip

***

[Image Omitted]

In just a few minutes
They felt their energy go high
The Red Stuff worked!
The label was no lie!

***

[Image Omitted]

"Time to fly!" shouted Kaia
And she jumped on the swing
While Pemma ran over
to the monkey rings

***

[Image Omitted]

Kaia pumped her legs
Like a good swinging flyer
She had never pumped so hard
She had never gone higher

***

[Image Omitted]

And Pemma on the rings
Made it all the way across
She had tried that before
But always had lost

***

[Image Omitted]

It took hours to get tired.
Then Kaia said "That's enough"
As they walked home they said
"We love RED STUFF"

***

[Image Omitted]

The next morning at breakfast
Kaia thought of a plan.
"Mom, some kids get an allowance.
Do you think we can?"

***

[Image Omitted]

"Okay kids, here is a deal.
If your homework is done and your bed is made,
If your room is clean.
Do that and you'll get paid"

***

[Image Omitted]

For many days
the kids did their chores and behaved
They got their allowances
and their allowances they saved

***

[Image Omitted]

Finally one day
Kaia raised both of her hands
"Pemma we now have enough,
for TEN cans!"

***

[Image Omitted]

"Ten cans of RED STUFF please"
This was quite a lot
But they had the money
So that's what they got

***

[Image Omitted]

Back to the Swings
Back to the Rings
They drank the RED STUFF
And did all the things

***

[Image Omitted]

Then they got tired
And sat on a tree
Drank another RED STUFF
And jumped up with glee

***

[Image Omitted]

"It's my turn on the rings!"
Pemma shouted very loud
"No it's my turn"
Kaia shouted back as loud as a crowd

***

[Image Omitted]

They struggled and struggled
And then Pemma ran
But Kaia followed her
Predicting her plan

***

[Image Omitted]

"This is my swing!"
Pemma screamed, and grabbed one
of the chains
"No its my swing!"
Kaia screamed back, as it started to rain.

***

[Image Omitted]

They tugged and they tugged
And said things to hurt
Then the chains snapped
And they fell to the dirt

***

[Image Omitted]

Both started crying
Just as their mother came around
"What happend?" she asked
Then she saw the cans on the ground.

***

[Image Omitted]

"Did you drink all of these?",
The kids nodded their heads.
"Uh huh. Yes we did",
They both said

***

[Image Omitted]

"Well, you drank the wrong stuff
And now you can see
That wasn't very wise
What you need is GOOD ENERGY"

***

[Image Omitted]

"Now its time for a bath
To take a nice soak.
And your next allowance will pay for
the swing that you broke"

***

[Image Omitted]

Weeks went by,
The girls did their chores and read books.
They even started to learn
How to cook.

***

[Image Omitted]

They learned about food,
Then something started to click.
One morning Kaia said
"I think I figured out the trick!"

***

Pemma could see,
Kaia had a new plan
"Back to the playgound!"
She said, and they ran

***

[Image Omitted]

Kaia swung higher than ever
And Pemma crossed the rings with just one puff
"We don't need energy drinks.
We just need to eat the RIGHT STUFF"

***

THE END

****
