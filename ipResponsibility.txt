All the benefits of property; none of the responsibility

If a pedestrian on the sidewalk is hit by a falling branch from a decaying tree on your property you are liable.

If those who insist on calling copyrights and patents "Intellectual Property" wish to continue to do that, I say we make them embrace all the responsibilities of property as well.

- If © TV programs carry ads for sugary drinks, and sugar turns out to cause many diseases, those TV networks are also liable.
- If actors and actresses star in those © ads, they are also liable.
- If newspaper © pages have ads for painkillers that turn out to be far more addictive than advertised, the paper is also liable.
- If a © textbook contains a model of health that turns out to be inaccurate and harmful, then the publisher(s) and author(s) are also liable.
- If a © song is played on a radio station in between ads for products that turn out to cause harm, the station and the musician(s) are also liable.
- If a non-public domain search engine shows ads for products that turn out to cause harm, that search engine is also liable.
- If a © software program causes its users to lose a signficant amount of time or resources, the software maker is also liable.
- If anyone claiming © over some media fails to update that media as soon as mistakes are discovered, they are liable.

Or do they just want all of the benefits of property rights, with none of the responsibilities?
