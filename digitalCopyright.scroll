title Digital Copyright and AIs

thinColumns 1

# AIs may train on everything. You may not.

In America, AIs have more freedoms than humans. This worries me.

Do you want to educate yourself at the same library as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Twitter's Grok, or Facebook's Llama?

Then you are *required* to become a criminal.

There is no legal way for you to do it^billion.

This sounds ridiculous.

_Surely humans would not make laws favoring AIs over humans._

But it is true.

***

It is true because Digital Copyright Law is real in America.

Big corporations have the resources to legally build massive internal libraries of all the world's published information.

Their AIs can legally train on this.

Humans in America have to choose: use a criminal library, or fall behind AIs?

***

# A Proposal

I propose we clearly pass into law that copyright does not apply to digital publications.

Among other benefits, this would ensure all Americans could legally educate themselves at the same library as AIs.

We can leave physical copyright alone.

***

# Does Digital Copyright matter?

Of course, we may not _need_ to update the law.

Digital copyright goes against the grain of nature so much that it has long been ignored and worked around by smart and noble minded citizens who have built these "criminal" libraries.

***

_But you never know._

Now might be a good time to set into law equal educational rights between humans and AIs.

While the laws are still set by humans.

# Notes

^billion Well, there is no legal way for YOU to do it. A billionaire could theoretically afford to buy the "rights" and build their own library as good as a big corporation. But no billionaire is reading this post. Nevertheless, to be precise, only ~756 out of ~333,333,000 Americans ~have a legal way to train on the same materials as AIs.
