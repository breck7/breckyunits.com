# Introducing Breck's Lab

For $49 a year, you get access to *brecks.lab*, the private git repository and issue board where I prioritize and shape my research.

- *Early Access*: See new research and code early, sometimes months before publication.

- *Influence*: Vote on which ideas you think deserve the most focus.

- *Meet*: Interact with other members on the issues board.

If you love science and the web, we have some _very_ exciting posts coming out this year.

You can wait for the published versions, or you can join *brecks.lab* today.

# Why sell lab access?

How are independent scientists to earn a living in a world without copyright and patents?

By selling lab access.

Independent scientists can do better science if

- They can publish everything to the public domain
- They have an empowered group of beta readers with shared interests
- They have less need to worry about revenue streams

Why not solve all three problems at once?

Labs is designed to help fix science.
