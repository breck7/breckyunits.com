Replies always welcome
======================

The waitress puts her earmuffs on.

She walks to the table, slams the food down, spins and runs away.

Sounds like an annoying customer experience, right?

No business would actually do this...right?

*

Well, in the digital world companies do this all the time.

They do it by blasting emails to their customers from `noreply@` email addresses.

*

The Golden Rule of Email
========================

A PSA for all businesses and startups. You could call it the _Golden Rule of Email_.

> Email others only if they can email you.

Never send emails from a `noreply@` or `donotreply@` email address.

If you can't handle the replies, don't send the email!

Let's make email human again!

*

At the very least, have an AI inbox
===================================

If your business doesn't have the staff to read and reply to emails, you can at least write automatic programs that can do _something_ for the customer.

*

_*No*_ Exceptions
=================

My claim is that `noreply@` email addresses are _always_ sub-optimal.

It is _never_ the right design decision. There is _always_ a better way.

Do you think you have an exception? You are wrong! (But let me hear it in the comments)

Appendix 1: Reader Responses
============================

Here are some reader examples with my responses:

My bank (Bank of Ireland) sends automated bi-monthly statements using noreply@boi.com
=====================================================================================
Bank of Ireland could end each email with a question such as "Anything we can do better? Let us know!". The responses could be aggregated and inform product development.

I follow many profiles on LinkedIn which sends me an occasional email on activities and updates that I might have missed using notifications-noreply@linkedin.com
=================================================================================================================================================================
LinkedIn could send these from a `replyToUnsubscribe@linkedin.com`. Replies will stop that kind of notifications.

GitHub sends me occasional emails about 3rd-party apps that have been granted access to my account using noreply@github.com
===========================================================================================================================
Github could send from `replyToDeauthorize@github.com`.

Google Maps sends monthly updates on my car journeys via noreply-maps-timeline@google.com
=========================================================================================
Could be a `replyToStopTracking@google.com`

Monthly newsletters to which I am subscribed via LinkedIn come in via newsletters-noreply@linkedin.com
======================================================================================================
Replies could get feedback to the newsletter author.

e-Books available from a monthly subscription are available on noreply@thewordbooks.com
=======================================================================================
Replies could be `replyWithYourReview@thewordbooks.com`.

Appendix 2: My one-man protest against no-reply email addresses
===============================================================

[Image Omitted]
 My automated campaign against no reply email addresses. Anytime a company sends a message from a noreply address they get this as a response. I am aware of the irony.
