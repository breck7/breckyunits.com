  Make a highly minimalistic black and white illustration, featuring two handsâ€”one of a child and one of an adult. The design focuses solely on their outlines. The child's hand is on the left and the adults is on the right. The adults hand is coming down at a slight angle. The childs hand is coming up at a slight angle. We see the back of the childs hand. We see the palm side of the adults hand. It looks like they were holding hands but something (that we dont see at all) pulled them apart. You can see that they are reaching as hard as they can to touch but the new distance between them is too hard to overcome

"How did you do it?"

The reporter asked, sitting across from her in the restaurant at the fancy hotel.

The girl looked at her. Then looked left and down. Then left and up and down again.

It was quiet for a long while.

She finally moved her throat.

"The shoes", she said, with tears in her eyes.
