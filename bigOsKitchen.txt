Menu Instructions
=================

Congrats on landing a job at Big O's Kitchen!

Our menu has *7 dishes*.

Below are the instructions for making each dish.

1. The Constant
===============
Dump one entire ingredient pack on one plate.

2. The Log
==========
Dump half an ingredient pack on one plate.
Then dump half that plate onto another plate.
Repeat until you make a plate with less than 2 ingredients.

3. The Linear
=============
Open one ingredient pack and put each ingredient on its own plate.

4. The Log Linear
=================
Open an ingredient pack and put each ingredient on its own plate.
Then dump half a new ingredient pack on each of those plates.
Then dump half of each of those plates onto another plate.
Repeat until you make a plate with less than 2 ingredients in each column.

5. The Quad
===========
Open an ingredient pack and put each ingredient on its own plate.
Then for each plate, open another ingredient pack.
Put each of those ingredients on its own plate and portion the original ingredient between those plates.

6. The Expo
===========
Open an ingredient pack.
Put one ingredient on one plate.
Then portion between two plates.
Add the next ingredient equally to all plates.
Now portion each plate into two plates.
Repeat until you have no more ingredients.

7. The Factory
==============
Make a plate for every combination of ingredients in the ingredient pack.

So if today's ingredient pack contains 3 ingredients (bacon, lettuce, and tomato) you should make 6 plates:

- 🥓🥬🍅
- 🥓🍅🥬
- 🥬🥓🍅
- 🍅🥓🥬
- 🥬🍅🥓
- 🍅🥬🥓
