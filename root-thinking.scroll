I dislike the term _first principles thinking_. It's vaguer than it needs to be. I present an alternate term: *root thinking*. It is shorter, more accurate, and contains a visual:

 caption Sometimes we get something wrong near the root which limits our late stage growth. To reach new heights, we have to backtrack and build up from a different point.

All formal systems can be represented as trees^tn. First Principles are simply the nodes at the root.

## Root thinking becomes more valuable as current growth slows
Technology grows very fast along its trendy branches. But eventually growth slows: there are always ceilings to the current path. As growth begins to slow, the ROI becomes higher for looking back for a path not taken, closer to the root, that could allow humans to reach new heights.

## Root thinking isn't as valuable when growth is rapid
If everyone practiced _root thinking_ all the time we would get nowhere. It's hard to know the limits to a current path without going down it. Perhaps we only need 1 in 100, perhaps even fewer, to research and reflect on the current path and see if we have some better choices. I haven't invested much thought yet to what the ideal ratio is, if there is even one.

## Notes
^tn Tree Notation is one minimal system for representing all structures as trees.
