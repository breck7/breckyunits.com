Newton, Darwin, and a modern Scientist go to heaven.

*

God is standing at the gate.

"Your research will determine whether you may enter heaven."

*

Newton is up first.

He shows God "Principia".

God smiles reading Newton's description of gravity.

God shakes his hand and opens the gate for him.

*

Next up is Darwin.

He shows God "Origin of Species".

God says "You nailed it!"

He lets him in.

*

Finally, the modern Scientist is up.

God asks to see his work.

"Sorry", he says.

"It's paywalled."
