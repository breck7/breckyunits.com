Newton, Darwin, and a modern-day scientist go to heaven.

*

God is at the gate.

"Your research shall determine whether you may enter."

*

Newton goes first.

He hands over _Principia_.

God reads Newton's description of gravity and smiles.

He waves him through.

*

Darwin goes next.

He hands over _Origin of Species_.

God scans it. "Bingo! You're in."

*

Finally, our modern-day scientist is up.

God asks for his work.

"Sorry", he says.

"It's paywalled."
