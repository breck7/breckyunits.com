Patents are Poison
==================

October 27, 2024

The censors do not want you to read this post.

They will downvote, flag, takedown, block and use any and all means to suppress these ideas.

They will call me names: a crank, crazy, unhinged, conspiracy theorist, lunatic.

They will say he is not an inventor (I am), has no research background (I do) and whatever else they can do to suppress this, short of responding to the ideas presented here.

Because they know that if they respond to the ideas then they will encourage you to actually think about them, and they know that if you start to think about them they've lost, because they know what I'm telling you is nature's simple truth.

That terrifies the censors. They know the stickiness of truth. They know that truths can be hard to see, but once you've seen truth you can't unsee it. Brains prefer shortcuts. And truths are shortcuts for predicting the world.

I'm giving you a shortcut to explain many of the problems in modern America: the opioid epidemic, cancer, obesity, mental health, the "pandemic", et cetera.

What is a shortcut to explain the root cause of many of these health problems?

Patents.

Patents they tell you are helping you are actually poisoning you.

Some points of agreement
========================

First, there are some points I think we can all agree with. Patents are awarded to novel inventions that have plausible utility. Patents encourage the publication of those inventions in some form. Patents are effective at discouraging unlicensed competitors and do create monopoly pricing power.

I agree with all those points.

But now let me present a new way to look at things.

*

What is a patent?
=================

A patent is embodied as a digital PDF. A PDF is just a long binary number.

Thus one can accurately say a patent is a long, seemingly random number.

The patent "owner" makes money by people paying to use that random number.

*

Patents incentivize the wrong thing
===================================

> Patents do not incentivize solving problems. Patents incentivize convincing people they need your random number.

If you've got a patent on a random number, you make no money if people solve their problems without your random number, but _monopoly money_ if they use your random number (regardless if it actually solves their problem).

As a result, companies are coming out with all sorts of random numbers that are great at generating monopoly profits, but terrible at solving people's problems.

*

More patents, more problems
===========================

Even better than just making monopoly money from one random number is to make monopoly money from a suite of random numbers.

Convince people that they need food made by your patented machines; foods that cause illnesses; illnesses which you say can only be cured by your patented medicines; medicines which cause side effects that you claim can only be cured by your other patented medicines; and your royalties will be royal!

Of course, your inventions are only solving problems that your other inventions created, but most people don't know that and so you can go on posting your stamped US Patent Certificates on LinkedIn and boasting about what a great innovator you are.

*

Patents stifle innovation
=========================

The worst thing that can happen to a patent holder is that someone actually figures out a solution to the problem their patent claims to solve while their patent is active.

Thus, once someone is granted a patent, they have strong *disincentive* to _actually_ solving someone's problems.

You do not want to publish or even fund anything that might show that your random number does not actually work.

You want to sit back and tell yourself "job well done" while collecting royalty checks.

*

Patents incentivize addiction
=============================

What's even better than selling an addictive drug? Having a legal monopoly on an addictive drug!

Patents richly reward those who can get vast numbers of people addicted to their random number.

This is exactly what happened with Purdue and the opioid epidemic. If you look at the legal docs, you'll see that step 1 in Purdue's playbook was to build an aggressive patent strategy.

Patents incentivize censorship, information control and dishonest advertising
=============================================================================

We've all seen how much big pharma advertises. Why on earth would they need to advertise their life saving medications?

Surely no news would travel faster by word-of-mouth than life saving inventions!

Unless of course, these medicines are not life-saving at all?

If the life saving inventions were the unpatented ones, then the only way for businesses to profit off patents would be to convince you of a lie.

Truth is free. Lies require advertising.

If you have to choose between owning a business with a monopoly or owning a business in a competitive field, the former makes far more money. The only requirement is you must dedicate a portion of your proceeds to brainwashing customers that they need your random number (they don't)!

*

I don't care if you share this post, but please do share these ideas
====================================================================

I could drone on and on along these lines, but I want to keep this (reasonably) short.

Please think about this for yourself: what do patents actually incentivize? Don't just repeat what people _tell you_ they incentivize. Think about it from first principles.

*

I am not in this for the money.

I am in this for the friends that I have lost.

Some of my best friends on this planet.

Dead. Buried. Poisoned by patents.

*

Again, don't take my word for it.

Please think about these ideas for yourself.

And remember that's exactly what the other side doesn't want you to do.
