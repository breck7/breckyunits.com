title Indented Heredocs Demo: Markdown, Textile, and BBCode in one file with no escaping
date 08-23-2021

paragraph
 TreeNotationüîótreenotation.org is a great glue notation for combining multiple languages into one file. On this demo page, I've extended the Scrollüîóscroll.pub grammar to include nodes for Markdownüîóen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown, Textileüîóen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language), and BBCodeüîóen.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode. (As well as a nifty special keyword as a bonus treat for readers who check out the sourceüîógithub.com/breck7/breckyunits.com/tree/main/markups )

section Indented Heredocs

paragraph
 One way to think of it is that TreeNotation discovered indented HereDocsüîóen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document. A single indent down your block is all you need, no end delimiters or encoding necessary. It takes a little getting used to (can be much better as tooling ecosystem improves), but I thoroughly enjoy it already and am surprised this simple trick was overlooked for so long.

section Quick Example

paragraph
 The code below:

scrollCode
 markdown
  ### Markdown is best
 
 textile
  *No!* _textile is best_
 
 bbCode
  [u]bbCode rules![/u]

paragraph
 Emits this:

markdown
 ### Markdown is best

textile
 *No!* _textile is best_

bbCode
 [u]bbCode rules![/u]

 Marked - Markdown Parser
 ========================
 
 [Marked] lets you convert [Markdown] into HTML.  Markdown is a simple text format whose goal is to be very easy to read and write, even when not converted to HTML.  This demo page will let you type anything you like and see how it gets converted.  Live.  No more waiting around.
 
 How To Use The Demo
 -------------------
 
 1. Type in stuff on the left.
 2. See the live updates on the right.
 
 That's it.  Pretty simple.  There's also a drop-down option in the upper right to switch between various views:
 
 - **Preview:**  A live display of the generated HTML as it would render in a browser.
 - **HTML Source:**  The generated HTML before your browser makes it pretty.
 - **Lexer Data:**  What [marked] uses internally, in case you like gory stuff like this.
 - **Quick Reference:**  A brief run-down of how to format things using markdown.
 
 Why Markdown?
 -------------
 
 It's easy.  It's not overly bloated, unlike HTML.  Also, as the creator of [markdown] says,
 
 > The overriding design goal for Markdown's
 > formatting syntax is to make it as readable
 > as possible. The idea is that a
 > Markdown-formatted document should be
 > publishable as-is, as plain text, without
 > looking like it's been marked up with tags
 > or formatting instructions.
 
 Ready to start writing?  Either start changing stuff on the left or
 [clear everything](/demo/?text=) with a simple click.
