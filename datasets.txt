I wrapped my fingers around the white ceramic mug in the cold air. I felt the warmth on my hands. The caramel colored surface released snakes of steam. I brought the cup to my lips and took a slow sip of the coffee bean flavored water inside.

Happiness is a hot cup of coffee in a ceramic mug on a cold day.

But, like happiness, heat is fleeting.

_How can I keep the coffee hot?_

*

I am using a free ceramic mug I got at a work conference.

_That's the issue_.

I pour my coffee into a ceramic mug I bought at HomeGoods.

_Expensive mugs hold heat better._

It gets cold anyway.

*

My hands can feel the heat rushing from the ceramic. It must be the material.

_That's the issue_.

I buy an insulated metal mug.

_A better material than ceramic is the most important thing for holding heat._

It gets cold anyway.

*

I combine my theories. I buy an expensive insulated metal mug.

It gets cold anyway.

_Wrong again_.

*

_Let me try a new approach._

I go back to HomeGoods and buy a thermometer and stopwatch.

I line up the 3 coffee mugs. Pour hot coffee in each.

Every five minutes, I write down the temperature in each mug.

I plot the data in a line chart.

There are some differences, but they are minor.

*

"What are you doing?" my cousin asks.

I explain the situation.

"Try my mugs, they have covers", he says.

I repeat the experiment and add the new data to my dataset.

 The lab. I measured how long these 5 coffee mugs kept coffee hot.

*

The coffee in my cousin's covered metal mugs stays hot.

_Materials *and covers* are the key_.

*

I still can't explain _why_.

_What is heat?_

I know I can build a much better model.

But I have successfully discarded false models.

And now I have a dataset to test all future models against.

Takeaways
=========

- *Datasets are automated tests for world models*.
- Building datasets can be done first, orthogonal to models. What Test Driven Development is to programming, Dataset Driven Development is to science.
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development Test Driven Development
- You can only hold so many concepts in your head at once, so automated testing from datasets helps more the more complex the system.
- Beware stories lacking datasets!
 https://breckyunits.com/dataset-needed.html Beware stories lacking datasets!
- Also beware stories that start with true datasets but then discreetly (but swiftly) switch to false ones.
- Love data sharers, beware data misers.
- An ounce of good data is worth a pound of bad models.
- An additional concept, measure, or measurement are all capable of triggering a huge leap toward a more accurate model.
- Datasets are a useful, simple, and timeless tool to discover better models.
- Datasets are particularly good at automating the identification of bad models.
- Tabular UIs have superior ergonomics for humans because they allow more efficient eye movement and require fewer tokens to manage.
- All that being said, remember that datasets are shadows, *ultimately the models, not the datasets, are the important thing*!

^liberties: There was no cousin, nor work conference, nor trips to HomeGoods, I used water and not coffee, and I exaggerated my ignorance and false models. The data and analysis is real.
^fun: Everyone^datasetNeeded agrees making datasets at home is extremely fun.
^datasetNeeded: Dataset needed.
