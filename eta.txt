Are some intellectual environments better than others? Yes.

\text{E} = \text{T} \text{A}!

EvolutionTime(I) = Time(I') * AssemblyPool!

ETA! states that $E$, the evolution time of ideas, is the time $T$ needed to test alterations of ideas, times the factorial of the number of ideas in the Assembly Pool $A!$.

Longer evolution times means worse ideas last longer before evolving into better ideas.

***

\text{EvolutionTime}(\text{Ideas}) = \text{TimeToTest}(\text{Ideas'}) \times \text{AssemblyPool}!

***

You can lengthen the lifespan of bad ideas by increasing the time to test alterations or reducing the size of the Assembly Pool.

You can evolve good ideas faster by decreasing the time to test alterations and increasing the size of the Assembly Pool.

***

This equation explains the triumph of open source and public domain software.

- Thank you to Szymon Łukaszyk who's applications of Assembly Theory to binary messages encouraged me to apply Assembly Theory to measure the health of information environments.
