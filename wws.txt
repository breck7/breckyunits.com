The World Wide Scroll
=====================

June 12, 2024

After years of development, I'm looking for beta testers for The World Wide Scroll (WWS).

*

The WWS is like the World Wide Web, except:
- *Intelligent.* Built not on HTML, but from the ground up in a simple, expandable language, designed for both humans and AIs.
 https://scroll.pub simple, expandable language
- *Offline.* You download entire sites and browse completely offline locally, rather than fetching one page at a time.
- *Pristine.* No ads, no paywalls, no trackers, no cookies, no copyright.
- *Human.* Instead of anonymous domains registered to corporations the WWS has folders owned by verified humans.
- *Trustworthy.* Source code behind every page.

*

If you know someone who might find this interesting, I'd appreciate it if you could share this with them.

The link to register a folder is:
https://wws.scroll.pub

The price to own a folder is $100 for 10 years.

Funds pay for the development of the Scroll language.

Mahalo!
