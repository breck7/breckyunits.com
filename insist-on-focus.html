<p>
 I read an interesting Twitter thread on <a

 
 href="https://twitter.com/markkofman/status/1366030683118833665">

 
 focus strategy</a>.

 
 That led me to the 3-minute YouTube video <a

 
 href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcohHIJr6Ns">

 
 Insist on Focus</a> by <a

 
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Rabois">Keith

 
 Rabois</a>. I created the transcript below.

 
</p>


<p><em><blockquote></p>
<p>
 One of the fundamental lessons I learned from Peter Thiel

 
 at PayPal was the value of focus. Peter had this somewhat

 
 absurd, but classically Peter way of insisting on focus,

 
 which is that he would only allow every employee to work on

 
 one thing and every executive to speak about one thing at a

 
 time, and he distributed this focus throughout the entire

 
 organization. So everybody was assigned exactly one thing,

 
 and that was the only thing you were allowed to work on,

 
 the only thing you were allowed to report back to him about.

 
</p>

<p>
 My top initiatives shifted around over the years, but I'll

 
 give you a few. One was initially Visa, MasterCard really

 
 hated us. We were operating at the edge of their rules at

 
 the time. My number one problem was to stop MasterCard

 
 particularly, but Visa a bit from killing us. So until I

 
 had that risk taken off the table, Peter didn't want to

 
 hear about any of my other ideas.

 
</p>

<p>
 Once we put Visa, MasterCard into a pretty stable place than

 
 eBay also wanted to kill us. Wasn't very happy with us

 
 processing 70% of the payments on their platform, so that

 
 was my next problem.

 
</p>

<p>
 Then 9/11 happened and the US Treasury Department

 
 promulgated regulations, which would require us among other

 
 things to collect Social Security numbers from all of our

 
 buyers, which would have suppressed our payment volumes

 
 substantially. So then my number one initiative became

 
 convincing the treasury department to not propagate these

 
 regulations, right post 9/11.

 
</p>

<p>
 At some point, we also needed to diversify our revenue off

 
 of eBay. So that became another initiative for me. That one

 
 I did not solve that well, which in some way led to us

 
 eventually agreeing to be acquired.

 
</p>

<p>
 I had another number one problem, which was this

 
 publication called the Red Herring, had published this set

 
 of unflattering articles about us and how to fix that and

 
 rebuild the communications team.

 
</p>

<p>
 Peter would constantly just assign me new things. He didn't

 
 like the terms of our financial services relationship with

 
 the vendors that we were using, so I took on that team and

 
 fixed the economics of those relationships, et cetera, et

 
 cetera, but they were not done in parallel. They're

 
 basically sequential. The reason why this was such a

 
 successful strategy is that most people, perhaps all people

 
 tend to substitute from A-plus problems that are very

 
 difficult to solve, to be a plus problems, which you know a

 
 solution to, or you understand the path to solve.

 
</p>

<p>
 You have a checklist every morning. Imagine waking up, and

 
 a lot of people write checklists and things to accomplish.

 
 Most people have an A-plus problem, but they don't know the

 
 solution so they procrastinate on that solution? And then

 
 they go down the checklist to the second or third

 
 initiative where they know the answer and they'll go solve

 
 those problems and cross them off. The problem is if your

 
 entire organization is always solving the second, third or

 
 fourth most important thing, you never solve the first.

 
</p>

<p>
 So Peter's technique of forcing people to only work on one

 
 thing meant everybody had to work on the A-plus problems.

 
 And if every part of the organization once in a while can

 
 solve a problem that the rest of the world thinks is

 
 impossible, you wind up with an iconic company that the

 
 world's never seen before.

 
</p>

<p></em></blockquote></p>

<p>
 I absolutely love the math behind this strategy. There are

 
 a few other terms to get right, but there's a fantastic idea here.
