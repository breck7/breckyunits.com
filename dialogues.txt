Scrolldown now has Dialogues
============================

hey. I just added Dialogues to Scrolldown.
cool. But what's Scrolldown?
Scrolldown is a new alternative to Markdown that is easier to extend.
how is it easier to extend?
because it's a tree language and tree languages are highly composable. for example, adding dialogues was a simple append of 11 lines of parser code and 16 lines of CSS.
okay, how do I use this new feature?

Dialogues seem to be a really common pattern in books and writings throughout history. So Scroll now supports that.

Here is the parser in the commit that added support for Dialogues:
