Is there a better way to build a blockchain? Yes.

> Particle Chain is a syntax-free storage format for the base layer of a blockchain to increase trust among non-expert users without sacrificing one iota of capabilities. A Particle Chain can be grokked by >10x as many people, thus leading to an order of magnitude increase in trust and developers on a chain.

RPM
===

R(C) =  P(C) \times M(C)

Reliability(Chain) =  Particles(Chain) * Mirrors(Chain)

RPM states that $R$, the reliability of a chain, is the number of particles $P$ times the number of independent mirrors of the chain $M$.

*

Reliability(Chain) =  Particles(Chain) \times Mirrors(Chain)

*

Chains that are mirrored more with more history are more reliable.

Implementing
============

The chain itself is encoded in Particles (Particle Syntax) which could be done with pen and paper, though for more utility it is recommended to build a digital Particle Chain üòâ.

For implementing a digital Particle Chain, the Parsers Programming Language (or a similar compiler compiler and virtual machine) may be used.

All existing chains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NEAR could be converted to a Particle Chain in a straightforward manner.

New chains would likely want to build on a Particle Chain from the start.
