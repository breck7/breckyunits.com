Is there a better way to build a blockchain? Yes.

[Image Omitted]
 A Particle Chain is a single plain text document of particles encoded in Particle Syntax with new transactions at the top of the document and an ID generated from the hash of the previous transaction.

RPM
===

R(C) =  P(C) \times M(C)

Reliability(Chain) =  Particles(Chain) * Mirrors(Chain)

RPM states that $R$, the reliability of the chain, is the number of particles $P$ times the number of independent mirrors of the chain $M$.

*

Reliability(Chain) =  Particles(Chain) \times Mirrors(Chain)

*

Chains that are mirrored more with more history are more reliable.

Implementing
============

The chain itself is encoded in Particles (Particle Syntax) which could be done with pen and paper. For better usability it is recommended to build a digital Particle Chain. For implementing that, the Parsers Programming Language (or a similar compiler compiler and virtual machine) may be used.
