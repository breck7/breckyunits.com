Is there a better way to build a blockchain? Yes.

RPM
===

R(C) =  P(C) \times M(C)

Reliability(Chain) =  Particles(Chain) * Mirrors(Chain)

RPM states that $R$, the reliability of the chain, is the number of particles $P$ times the number of independent mirrors of the chain $M$.

*

Reliability(Chain) =  Particles(Chain) \times Mirrors(Chain)

*

Chains that are mirrored more with more history are more reliable.
