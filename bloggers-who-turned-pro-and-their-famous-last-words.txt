Bloggers Turning Pro

“Although it didn’t start out that way, The Daily Motivator is now my full-time job. Back in 1995 I started writing the messages as part of another website. Within a few months, the response was so positive that The Daily Motivator took on a life of its own. After five years or so, subscription sales and book sales were providing a modest income, and since that time the website has grown to the point where I am able to devote all my working hours to it.” [source]

The self-described “media junkie” and Maryland native spends at least 40 hours a week researching and writing the blog on top of her full-time job as a media planner in San Francisco. [source]
