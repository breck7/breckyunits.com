I just pushed version 93.0.0 of my language Scroll. *Version 93*!

Why so many versions? I use Tom Preston-Warner's Semantic Versioning (2011).
 https://semver.org/ Semantic Versioning

In particular, I followed his advice in Major Version Numbers are Not Sacred.

Pushing so many major versions was no big deal because Scroll was a toy.

But Scroll now has a novel feature that makes it very useful.

I need to decide if I should ship fewer major versions with higher quality.

Let's do some research on what other programming language developers are doing.

I added version number data to over 600 languages in PLDB.

What major version are programming languages on?
================================================
0 Min
1 Median
2.9 Average
73%  If you’re changing the API every day you should...still be in version 0.y.z

Whoops!

It took me about 5 years to figure out what Scroll 1.0.0 should be. I should be on version 0.93.0, not version 93.0.0.

No big deal. I will soon release Scroll 100.0.0, and from then on will have far fewer major releases.

An ounce of deep thought on the core of your language is worth a pound of major releases!

Other things I learned
======================

- I learned 97.5% of languages with a version system use Semantic Versioning. The ~2% of languages, such as C and C++, that are still doing versions like C17 (which does not mean major version 17, but refers to the year the revision came out), maybe want to reconsider ;).
- I learned most languages use git tags for tagging their releases. Something I should start doing.

I learned a few things today. Hope you did too!

- Thank you to redditors Greenbeen86, subgeniuskitty, and chibuku_chauya for pointing out the bug with the C and C++ rows.
