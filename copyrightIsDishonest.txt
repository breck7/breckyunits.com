The Consultation Problem and Why Copyright is Dishonest at its Core

Symbols are useless unless consulted.

Consulting consumes energy.

Everyone has finite energy.

*

Consulting can be sequential or—via computation—simultaneous.

*

I call symbols with no legal restrictions the *Unchained*.

The *Unchained* is too large to be consulted sequentially.

The *Unchained* can be consulted computationally and so simultaneously.

*

I call symbols with legal restrictions the *Chained*.

The *Chained* is too large to be consulted sequentially.

The *Chained* may not be consulted computationally and thus cannot be consulted simultaneously.

*

Because the *Chained* may not be consulted computationally, consulting from the *Chained* and consulting from the *Unchained* are exclusive operations.

Sequentially consulting the *Chained* reduces energy available for simultaneously consulting the *Unchained*.

Thus, the *Chainer*'s implicit argument is that sequentially consulting their *Chained* symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting the *Unchained*.

*

A *Chainer* mathematician claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting Euclid, Gauss, and Euler.
A *Chainer* physicist claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein.
A *Chainer* musician claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart.
A *Chainer* biologist claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting Leeuwenhoek, Pasteur, and Darwin.
A *Chainer* artist claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting da Vinci, Rembrandt, and van Gogh.
A *Chainer* author claims sequentially consulting their symbols is worth more than simultaneously consulting Homer, Shakespeare, and Dostoevsky.

*Chainer**s* claim their symbols ought be treated with more consideration than the symbols of these greats.

I hope you see why this is such a ridiculously dishonest position, and understand my visceral disgust for this behavior.

*

© is the mark of the *Chainer*. It is the mark of the dishonest man.

I salute and lend my hands to the honest men who contribute symbols to the great *Unchained*. They have an honest estimation of their humble contributions in relation to the whole. It is on their shoulders that the future is built.
