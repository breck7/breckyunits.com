Censorship on Reddit is likely deadly

Imagine a lot of people are given a diagnosis that they have some genetic illness that cannot be cured, but must be treated with expensive, harmful medications. Oh yeah, and the medications don't actually cure anything, they just "manage it". Imagine there is no accurate biological model backing this, but thousands of PhDs that are part of and paid by this system, which generates billions in revenue each year.

Now imagine there is actually an _accurate_ biological model of this condition and the treatment isn't medication at all, but largely about foods.

Now imagine that this latter truth is censored by Reddit moderators. Imagine millions following the fraudulent treatments, and many of those dying or killing themselves.

Imagine all of the broken families.

This is not a hypothetical. This is happening right now, and you can see it for yourself.

Yesterday researchers at the University of Edinburgh published a study on the effectiveness of a high-fat, low-carb diet (aka "ketogenic diet") for helping people who are diagnosed with "bipolar disorder". The study was shared by scientists and doctors worldwide, probably the first time this theory has gone mainstream. But for those of us studying this issue, it's no surprise. All the vectors point to this idea addressing the root cause of these energy swings and of keto being the most effective cure for this condition.

This is an amazing development, and will save many lives. I will continue to do my part to share this research.

But the suppression of this information is just one example of a general pattern of deadly information control and censorship in America today.

We need to do everything we can to fix this.
