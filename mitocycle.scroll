# Your body has approximately:
## 30,000,000,000,000 Cells
## 30,000,000,000,000,000 Mitochondria

Everything goes in cycles.

So it surprises me there's not a word "mitocycle".

***

Mitochondria were first seen with optical microscopes in the late 1800's.

In the 1950's  electron microscopes gave us our first good look at them.
