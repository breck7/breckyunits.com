Infinite Futures
================

February 12, 2013

You shouldn't plan for _the_ future. You should plan for *one of many* futures.

The world goes down many paths. We only get to observe one, but they all happen.

In the movie "Back to the Future II", the main character Marty, after traveling decades into the future, buys a sports alamanac so he can go back in time and make easy money betting on games. Marty's mistake was thought he had the guide to _the_ future. He thought there was only one version of the future. In fact, there are many versions of the future. He only had the guide to _one version_.

Marty was like the kid who stole the answer key to an SAT but still failed. There are many versions of the test.

There are infinite futures. Prepare for them all!
