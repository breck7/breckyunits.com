Microprogramming: A New Way to Program
======================================

All jobs done by large monolithic software programs can be done better by a collection of small microprograms (mostly 1 line long) working together.

Microprogramming is a style of programming inspired by _Micro_biology

Building these microprograms, aka _microprogramming_, is different than traditional programming. Microprogramming is more like gardening: one is constantly introducing new microprograms and removing microprograms that aren't thriving. Microprogramming is like organic city growth, whereas programming is like top-down centralized city planning. Microprogramming is putting the necessary microprograms in a petri dish, applying natural selection over time until they can beautifully and most simply solve your problem.

*

In a microprogram every line of code can be its own program.

Type,Files,Lines Of Code,Programs
Programming,1,1000,1
Microprogramming,1,1000,200-300

*

Microprogramming requires new languages. A language must make it completely painless to concatenate, copy/paste, extend and mix/match different collections of microprograms. Languages must be robust against stray characters and support parallel parsing and compilation. Languages must be context sensitive. Languages must be homoiconic. Automated integration tests of frequently paired microprograms are essential.

*

Microprograms start out small and seemingly trivial, but evolve to be far faster, more intelligent, more agile, more efficient, and easier to scale than traditional programs.

*

Microprogramming works _incredibly well_ with LLMs. It is easy to mix and match microprograms written by humans with microprograms written by LLMs.

*

These are just some initial observations I have had so far since our invention of a breakthrough microprogramming language stack. This document you are reading is written as a collection of microprograms in a language called Scroll, a language which is a collection of microprograms in a language called Parsers, which is a collection of microprograms written in itself (but also with a last mile conversion to machine code via TypeScript).

If the microprogramming trend becomes as big, if not bigger, than microservices, I would not be surprised.

Microprogramming is inspired by microbiology.

You may know me as the creator of PLDB (a Programming Language DataBase), earth's largest database on Programming Languages, and find it relevant that I have personally studied and reviewed information on over 5,000 programming languages - nearly 100% of all publicly used languages.
 https://pldb.io/ PLDB

What you might not know is that I also have a peer-reviewed track record in genomics and multiomics, and that Parsers, the language we invented that enabled Microprogramming, is built not on the patterns I found in programming languages, but instead built on the patterns nature evolved that I studied in microbiology.

The biological design is why this stack is unlike any language you have used before. You will be able to build any advanced program you could build using a traditional language, but the path to that solution may be very different. Once you've mastered this stack, I expect you will be astonished at how much you can do with so little.

The payoff from this biological approach will become increasingly apparent over time, as we continue to do things with this stack with radically less code than traditional approaches.

This is the dawn of a new paradigm shift in programming, and my job is to provide you with the truest, clearest, most concise information I have gathered over the past two decades so you can take this technology and build a better future for us all.

comment Good question! This line is a microprogram.

 comment This block is also a microprogram
 pattern comment string*

comment Microprograms are 1 or more lines that are as easy to move around and concatenate as legos. It is accurate to model them as functions that take zero or more parameters. Each line/block is a function definition or application.

Great point! I should mention some data.

Parsers is made of ~100 microprograms.
 https://sdk.scroll.pub/designer/index.html#standard%20parsers ~100 microprograms

Scroll is built on Parses and made of ~1,000 microprograms.
 https://scroll.pub/cloc.html ~1,000 microprograms.

PLDB.io is built on Scroll and made of ~10,000 microprograms.
 https://github.com/breck7/pldb ~10,000 microprograms

Great question!

Microprogramming is using languages where every single line is capable of being a microprogram.

Below is an example of microprogramming. This is the code that generates the homepage for BuilderNews https://news.pub . I annotated everyline to explain it in the terminology of microprogramming.

You can also view and edit it with syntax highlighting.

redneckhatr asks "How does this work underhood? Is a microprogram an actual binary or something you load into a VM?"

Great question!

That's up to the implementation. This is a design pattern that can be implemented in many ways. Even without a computer!

Requirements to implement this:

1. An environment
2. Microprogram parsers
3. Microprograms

Here's a video explanation:
