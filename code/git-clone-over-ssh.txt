Git Clone over SSH
==================
July 8, 2021

Using Git with your own servers—without a hub like GitHub or GitLab—is easy. This is the straightforward, quick and dirty way with no new concepts to learn. There are more advanced ways (like -bare), but I find 4 times out of 5 I just need a quick way to sync repos between machines.

Cloning from your server to your local machine
==============================================

git clone ssh://breck@example.com/home/breck/project

Pushing to your server from your local machine
==============================================

The one annoying thing here is your push will be rejected if your are pushing the branch that is currently checked out on the server. You can quickly check out a temporary branch, push main, and then check main back out on the server.
