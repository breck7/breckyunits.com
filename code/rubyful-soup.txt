Rubyful Soup
============
August 14, 2010

I was a big fan of BeautifulSoup in Python and was excited to see a Ruby port. Sadly it's no longer being maintained.

To get v1.0.4 working with Ruby 1.9.2, I had to make the following changes to the rubyful_soup.rb file in my gems directory:

- Line 19 - comment out 'require 'jcode''
- Line 233 - remove the colon

Built with Scroll v125.8.0
