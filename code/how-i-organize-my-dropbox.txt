How I organize my Dropbox
=========================
November 27, 2009

Gmail encourages users to "search not sort". I do that. Email works great for search. For files though, sorting is often better.

I have well over 20GB of files synced onto my Dropbox. The rest of my computer is spotless(I use Windows 7 and do a fresh install every 30-60 days). But the Dropbox can get cluttered. I take a simple approach that is a hybrid of search and sort. Here's how to do it:

Put files into 2 sections:

- Create a folder in your root Dropbox directory named "Search". Plop anything in here.
- Keep your most common folders in the root Dropbox directory. Sort these ones.
- Every few weeks, move any rarely used files and folders into the "Search" directory. Bring any commonly used files and folders back out to the root Dropbox directory.

End Result
==========

Here's what the end result may look like:

```
-My Dropbox
--Music
--Photos
--Blog
--eBooks
--Company Docs
--Search
```

The first directories are the ones you access a lot and are well sorted and maintained. The last directory is a mess of random files and folders that you've collected. You can browse through it, but it's easier to just run a search on it when you need something.

This a hybrid of search and sort.

 Notes
======

- 1. All of my coding work is done in my cygwin home directory and then pushed to github. These are the only files that I don't store in Dropbox, but I push them frequently so don't worry much about losing them.
