Git ignore a file that's in the repo
====================================
October 3, 2010

Let's say you've got a file that's checked in like environment.rb that you want to edit for your local machine only and don't want to push the changes to your repository. It's easy, just do:

```
git update-index --assume-unchanged filepath
```

And to reverse:

```
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged filepath
```
