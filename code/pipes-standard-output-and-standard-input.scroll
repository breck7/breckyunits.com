 In linux, standard input refers to the stream of bits that come from your keyboard.

paragraph
 Standard output refers to the stream of bits that appear on your screen(terminal).

paragraph
 You can change this around so that standard input comes from another source(say, a file) or so that standard output gets directed somewhere else (say, a file).

paragraph
 For example, say we wanted to email someone a file containing the contents of our home directory. We could do this:

code
 ls ~ | vim -

paragraph
 This will pipe the output from the ls command to vim. You can then edit and save this file normally as you would in vim.

paragraph
 There's another type of pipe you could use for this example: greater than.

code
 ls ~ > contents.txt

paragraph
 This will redirect the output to the contents.txt file.

paragraph
 You can also append output by using two greater than signs:

code
 ls ~ >> some_file.txt

paragraph
 As you would expect, the less than sign can be used to direct a file as standard in.
