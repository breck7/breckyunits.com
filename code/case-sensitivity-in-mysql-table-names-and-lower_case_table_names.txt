Case sensitivity in MySQL table names and lower_case_table_names
================================================================
February 27, 2010

On linux, filenames and directories are case sensitive. <code>file</code> and <code>File</code> are different files.

On Windows, filenames are not case sensitive. <code>file</code> and <code>File</code> are the same file.

MySQL saves a database to disk. A "database" is saved in a directory, and each table is saved as a file in that folder.

Thus, say you transfer a database from Linux to Windows that has a table named "userBookmarks", this might cause a problem for you because MySQL on Windows will likely interpret it as "userbookmarks".

There's a setting in your my.cnf file called "lower_case_table_names".

The options are 0, 1, and 2.

1 is the default, and you shouldn't need to change it.

If you change it to 0 on Windows, you might run into problems. If you change it to 2, it doesn't seem to do much.

So what's the solution? Try to avoid capital letters in table names (use _ instead of camel case). When you can't do that, write your code for the Linux database (ie "select * from userBookmarks"), and your queries should translate fine on Windows since Windows will convert that to "select * from userbookmarks".
