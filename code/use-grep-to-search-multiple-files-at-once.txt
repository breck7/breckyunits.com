Use grep to search multiple files at once
=========================================
November 22, 2009

`grep` lets you search through multiple text files at once.

I recently removed a feature from a project and wanted to make sure I removed all references to it. With grep it was easy:

grep -r picture *

This searched all the files in my current directory as well as all the files in each subdirectory, and printed the filename and line where the word "picture" appeared.

Then I went in and changed the 2 files that needed modifying.

Had I wanted to just search the current directory (without the subdirectories) I could have done:

grep picture *.*

This would have searched through all the files in the current directory.

Had I wanted to search in just 1 specific file:

grep picture filename.txt

Had I wanted to do a case insensitive search:

grep -ir picture *

Had I wanted to exclude a directory and done a case insensitive search:

grep -ri "searchstring" --exclude="*\.svn*" *

(grep uses regular expressions)
