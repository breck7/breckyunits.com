Use cat to combine or print the contents of a file
==================================================
December 26, 2009

Print the contents of a file:

```
cat filename.txt
```

Pipe the contents of the file to less, so you can view it one page at a time:

```
cat filename | less
```

In less, the 3 key commands are:

- spacebar to go forward one page
- b to go back one page
- q to quit

You can also do regular expression searches like in vim: /regex (n to go to next match)

Append file1 to the end of file 2:

```
cat file1 >> file2
```

Combine two files into a third file:

```
cat file1 file2 > file3
```
