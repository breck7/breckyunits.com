Bash variables
==============
December 18, 2009

$ FIVE=5
$ echo $FIVE
5
$ echo "The number five is $FIVE"

Variable scope
==============

A shell script will launch a new shell that has a fresh scope.

$ FIVE = 5
$ vim myshellscript.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo $FIVE
$ ./myshellscript.sh

Blank because the executed script doesn't affect the current shell. To make something affect the current shell, use the source command.

Export command.
===============

Use the export command to change the scope of your variable to global for your shell.

To make a permanent global variable, add it to your .bash_profile like so:

MY_NAME=breck; export MY_NAME

Accept input.
=============

Use the read command to accept input.

echo "What is 1+1?"
read ANSWER
echo "Your answer is $ANSWER"
