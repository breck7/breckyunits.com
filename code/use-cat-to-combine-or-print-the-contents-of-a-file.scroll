title Use cat to combine or print the contents of a file

import header.scroll

thinColumns 2

keyboardNav

Print the contents of a file:
 dateline

code
 cat filename.txt

Pipe the contents of the file to less, so you can view it one page at a time:

code
 cat filename | less

In less, the 3 key commands are:

- spacebar to go forward one page
- b to go back one page
- q to quit

You can also do regular expression searches like in vim: /regex (n to go to next match)

Append file1 to the end of file 2:

code
 cat file1 >> file2

Combine two files into a third file:

code
 cat file1 file2 > file3

import footer.scroll
