What non-web software do you use the most?
==========================================
November 26, 2009

Here are the programs I use everyday, every week, and every month.

What software do you use the most? What are your "must haves"?

My Machines
===========

My primary development machine is a basic Compaq laptop with 4GB, 230GB, x2 Core Athlon, running Windows Vista/7.

My secondary machine is an Asus EEE netbook with XP which is great for working on the road, at a coffee shop, or on a plane.

Most of our servers are slices from slicehost running Fedora.

On all my development machines I run Cygwin. Programs I run in Cygwin are noted by *.

The following is a list of the programs I use on my development machines.

Daily
=====

- <b>Cygwin</b>. I prefer Windows+cygwin over Macs, Fedora or Ubuntu, or Windows plus running virtualized machines.
- <b>Notepad++</b>. I do half my editing in Notepad++ and half in Vim. I love Notepad++'s speed, reliability, and autocomplete.
- <b>Dropbox</b>. Completely changed how I work. Allows me to work from multiple computers seamlessly. Allows me to share files easily with clients, family, and friends. Reinstalling Windows (which I do a few times per year), is made easy because all my important files are kept on my dropbox. The fact that install and uninstall is so easy and doesn't require a reboot really impresses me.
- <b>WAMP</b>. The "AMP" stack is what I develop for mostly. WAMP gives me an easy local testing environment to try things out before pushing to a server.
- <b>Chrome</b>. I spend most of my web time in Chrome. It's lighting fast. It's also simple. Tabs are done incredibly well.
- <b>Firefox</b>. Still need this guy. The extensions are great. Firebug and the Web Developer's Extension I use at least weekly, close to daily. It's also nice to have 2 browsers going if you want to log in to the same site with 2 different accounts.
- <b>Skype</b>. I don't use a cellphone, believe it or not. My Google Voice number points to my Skype In number. Skype allows me to not have a cellphone, which I greatly appreciate. My sister can call me from the Middle East just as easily and for the same price that my neighbors can call me from down the street.
- <b>*Vim</b>. The only Nix editor I know and love. Vim took me a while to learn, but is becoming more and more indispensable the better I get at "typing in Vim".
- <b>*Git</b>. Easy to use version control that makes sense. Paired with github, becomes indispensable.
- <b>*Rsync</b>. Great for deploying simple websites and for downloading backups.
- <b>*Grep</b>. Great when you need to track down a word or line across multiple files.
- <b>*Find</b>. Simple and easy for finding files. I also use find over Windows 7's search occasionally.
- <b>*Cron</b>. Simple and essential.
- <b>*SSH</b>. Of course.
- <b>*Ruby</b>. I keep irb running in a window when I need to do quick calculations.

Weekly
======

- <b>Navicat</b>. Great way to keep an eye on databases. I also like it for creating and editing schemas. Find it easier to visualize a schema than to code it out.
- <b>Filezilla</b>. Occasionally when I just want to drag and drop some things from or to a server.
- <b>Photoshop</b>. I use an old version of Photoshop which is still way to advanced for me. But it's fast and gets the job done.
- <b>7zip</b>. "Extract to here" is a great little feature that it adds to the right click menu.
- <b>Word & Excel 2007</b>. Solid programs. Too bulky for my liking, but necessary in many cases.

Monthly
=======

- <b>Visual Studio</b>. When I get an urge to write a new desktop program.
