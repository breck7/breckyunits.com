Use aliases to save time
========================
November 28, 2009

Using aliases in Linux can save you a lot of time. Here's an example:

alias www='cd /var/www/html/'

Instead of typing "cd /var/www/html/" to enter your web directory, now you can enter "www", a savings of at least 14 keystrokes each time you use it.

This one will switch to the usr/sbin directory, restart apache, then switch to your home directory:

alias apr='cd /usr/sbin/;sudo ./apachectl restart;cd'

You can also just do:

alias apr='/usr/sbin/apachectl restart'

But the earlier example shows how you can string multiple commands together.

Bonus tip
=========

Place these aliases in your HOME/.bash_profile file and they will be available each time you login to your machine.

Notes
=====

- 1. "At least" 14 keystrokes, because the # of typos increases as the # of characters typed increases.
