Bug Workaround for JS Charts Error: Not enough data to display chart
====================================================================
January 16, 2010

```
nullData = new Array( );
myChart.setDataArray(nullData,"null");
```

Add these 2 lines to your javascript.

Basically, if the first data set has only 1 data point, JSCharts will fire the alert. If it has 0 or 2+ data points, it won't. This fix creates an empty data series which disables this alert.
