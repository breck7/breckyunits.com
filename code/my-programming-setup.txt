My Programming Setup
====================
May 30, 2011

Here's my setup. This is kind of for my reference but you can also check it out if you're interested.

- Macbook Air. 4GB. 256GB HD.
- VMWare Fusion almost solely to run Notepad++
- In Fusion I removed the Apple+W shortcut they map by default. Also, I map the Apple Key to the windows Ctrl key and the Mac control key to the Windows Key.
- I configure Notepad++ to use 2 spaces instead of tabs.
- I run Fusion in Unity mode and have the Windows taskbar at the bottom of the screen.
- I make the Mac tray pretty small at the bottom of the screen and set it to disappear.
- I run Cinch on my Mac to get the next drag and drop for side by side comparison function that comes with Windows 7.
- I run Dropbox on the Mac. I share a folder using Fusion to have access to it in Windows.
- I disable network access on the Windows virtual machine so I don't have to worry about viruses etc on that guy.
- I enabled a firmware password on my macbook.
- I add a lot of things to my bash_profile on the mac and pretty much always have at least 1 terminal window open.
- I use textmate on the mac occasionally but try to do all my work in Notepad++.
- I run MAMP on the Mac and WAMP on the WinVM.
- I bump up the font size on a lot of things like terminal etc.
- I go to "Keyboard" on the Mac and enable function keys. That way F1 works like you'd expect and you have to hit Fn+F1 to adjust the screen brightness.

Built with Scroll v162.1.0
