cron in 2 steps
===============
November 25, 2009

`cron` lets you schedule linux commands to execute on a regular basis.

For instance, say we want to run the command "wget http://yourdomain.com/backup.zip" each hour, that downloads a backup of one of your websites.

Step 1: Write the cron command
==============================

Here is the cron command you would need:

```
0  *  *  *  *  wget http://yourdomain.com/backup.zip
```

You can either memorize the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#crontab_syntax">crontab syntax</a>, or just this simple Javascript <a href="http://www.openjs.com/scripts/jslibrary/demos/crontab.php">crontab gui</a> will easily generate the code for you.

Step 2: Append the command to your crontab file
===============================================

There are 2 crontab files that get executed every minute. 1 of them is found in /etc or similar and is controlled by root only. In addition, each user can have a crontab.

To add your command to crontab type:

```
crontab -e
```

This will open vim, and you can then paste and save your crontab file.

Viola!

Notes
=====

1. If you are using cron in cygwin, follow <a href="http://www.newmedialogic.com/node/33">these steps</a> after installing the cron package with the cygwin installer to install cron as a service:

```
cygrunsrv -I cron -p /usr/sbin/cron -a D

net start cron
```

If there are problems, check the cron.log file in your home directory.
