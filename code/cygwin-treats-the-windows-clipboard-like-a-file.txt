Cygwin treats the Windows Clipboard like a file
===============================================
December 30, 2009

In Linux every thing is a file. This is great because it means the Windows clipboard is a file too!

Want to copy the current cygwin directory into your clipboard?

pwd > /dev/clipboard

Want to print the contents of the clipboard?

cat /dev/clipboard
