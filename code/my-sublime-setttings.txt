My Sublime Settings
===================
June 21, 2022

I'm going to start sticking my Sublime Text settings and plugins here.

"goto_anything_exclude_gitignore": true,

This setting is new *devBuilds* in ST4 (Build 4130 released on March 23, 2022). Set it to true and any file that matches your `.gitignore` patterns will not show up in ST's autocomplete, navigation, et cetera. Found this one on StackOverflow.
