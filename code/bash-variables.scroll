# Variable scope

* A shell script will launch a new shell that has a fresh scope.
 dateline

code
 $ FIVE = 5
 $ vim myshellscript.sh
 #!/bin/bash
 echo $FIVE
 $ ./myshellscript.sh

* Blank because the executed script doesn't affect the current shell. To make something affect the current shell, use the source command.

# Export command.

* Use the export command to change the scope of your variable to global for your shell.

* To make a permanent global variable, add it to your .bash_profile like so:

code
 MY_NAME=breck; export MY_NAME

# Accept input.

* Use the read command to accept input.

code
 echo "What is 1+1?"
 read ANSWER
 echo "Your answer is $ANSWER"
