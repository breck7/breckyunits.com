New tricks in Vim
=================
December 29, 2009

I learned some new tricks with vim today.

4G - Move to line #4
mb - Mark the current spot as point b 'b - Go back to point b
vim file1 file2 - open 2 files at once
:e file - edit a different file
:split file - split the current window and edit a different file (vsplit for vertical split)
ctrl+w j/k - move down/up a window
:hide - hide the current window
:ls - show current buffers
