title Recursive Sed

import pageHeader.scroll

As far as I can tell, sed doesn't have a recursive mode. Here's a little script that uses perl to simulate a recursive sed:

code
 #!/bin/bash
 perl -e "s/$1/$2/g;" -pi $(find . -type f)

I put this in a file named ~/rsed

Then in my .bash_profile:

code
 alias rsed="~/rsed"

Now I can use it like so:

code
 rsed old new

import footer.scroll
