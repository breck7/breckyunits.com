Fix for "selinux 3.82" stuck while installing Ubuntu from USB Drive
===================================================================
June 27, 2011

If you are installing Ubuntu from USB and are getting stuck at the "SELINUX 3.82" screen, you'll need to edit the selinux/selinux.cnf file on the USB stick and comment out the "vesamenu.c32" line, and remove the "ui" from the last line.
