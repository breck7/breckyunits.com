Use rsync to deploy your website
================================
November 21, 2009

`rsync` is a nifty little tool that can deploy a website to a testing or production server.

Here's a one line command to deploy brecksblog:

```
rsync -arvuz /home/user/brecksblog breck32@breckyunits.com:/var/www/html/ --exclude '.git' --exclude 'deploy' --exclude 'README' --exclude 'posts.php'
```

This one line will do a fast, incremental file transfer from my local directory to the web server.

I saved this file as "deploy", and then run it by typing:

```
./deploy
```

The exclude option will exclude a file or directory from being synced.

Here's an explanation about the options I use. I use rsync with these options:

```
rsync -arvuz /src/foo/ /dest/foo
```

This will copy the contents of /src/foo/ into /dest/foo. Options explained:

- a: archive mode (keep owner and permissions)
- r: recurse into directories
- v: increase verbosity
- u: update only (don't overwrite newer files - if you have edited files in destination)
- z: compress file data
