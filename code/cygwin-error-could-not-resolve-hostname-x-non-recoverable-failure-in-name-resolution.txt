Cygwin Error: Could not resolve hostname X: Non-recoverable failure in name resolution
======================================================================================
February 21, 2010

I've been getting this error a lot in Cygwin on Windows 7:

```
Could not resolve hostname X: Non-recoverable failure in name resolution
```

It happens a lot when I run a deploy script or git push. Haven't found a solution yet, and am trying to track one down.

The problem is this bug is hard to reproduce. It happens only 5-10% of the time.

Edit #1:
 Helpful article from Microsoft on Host Name Resolution

Edit #2:
 Upon closer examination, it seems this error only happens with ssh:

```
ssh: Could not resolve hostname X: Non-recoverable failure in name resolution
```

That's narrowed it down a bit but still no solution. Sadly because it only happens once or twice out of 10-20 times I run the "ssh" command, it's taking longer to pin down.
