ngrep for packet monitoring
===========================
July 13, 2011

I just came across a neat command line tool, ngrep, via this <a href="http://www.coderholic.com/invaluable-command-line-tools-for-web-developers/">site</a>.

Sample usage:

```
ngrep -q -W byline "^(GET|POST) .*"
```

Built with Scroll v174.2.0
