Recursive Sed
=============
August 5, 2011

As far as I can tell, sed doesn't have a recursive mode. Here's a little script that uses perl to simulate a recursive sed:

```
#!/bin/bash
perl -e "s/$1/$2/g;" -pi $(find . -type f)
```

I put this in a file named ~/rsed

Then in my .bash_profile:

```
alias rsed="~/rsed"
```

Now I can use it like so:

```
rsed old new
```
