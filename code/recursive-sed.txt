Recursive Sed
=============
August 5, 2011

As far as I can tell, sed doesn't have a recursive mode. Here's a little script that uses perl to simulate a recursive sed:

#!/bin/bash
perl -e "s/$1/$2/g;" -pi $(find . -type f)

I put this in a file named ~/rsed

Then in my .bash_profile:

alias rsed="~/rsed"

Now I can use it like so:

rsed old new
