import pageHeader.scroll

Want to know how to run two or more linux commands sequentially? It's simple: use the semicolon ;.

For instance:

code
 cd;ls

This will change the directory to your home directory, then list the contents. You can use as many semicolons as you wish.

Another option is to use && if you only want the next command to execute if the previous command executed successfully.

code
 cd ~/myfiles; cp file.txt ~/backup/ && rm file.txt

This will only run the last command if the cp command executed successfully.

You can swap the && for || to run a command if the previous one fails.
