List only directories using ls
==============================
December 13, 2009

The `ls` command lists all files and directories. What if you just wanted to list the directories?

ls -l | egrep '^d'

Add this to your .bash_profile and now you can just type "lsd" when you want list only directories. Who said lsd was a bad thing?

alias lsd="ls -l | egrep '^d'"
