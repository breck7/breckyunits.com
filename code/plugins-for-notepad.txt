Plugins for Notepad++
=====================
February 6, 2010

Notepad++ is my go to editor.

The default plugins are great, but if you need more just visit <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/notepad-plus/index.php?title=Plugin_Central">the notepad++ plugins list</a>.

To install a plugin:

- 1. Download the zip file and unzip it.
- 2. Copy the dll to your Program Files/Notepad++/Plugins folder.

The main plugin I've used so far is Explorer. I'll update this in the future with other ones.

That's it!

Built with Scroll v177.0.0
