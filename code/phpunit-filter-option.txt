PHPUnit Filter Option
=====================
August 10, 2010

Say you are running PHPUnit from the command line and want to run just a specific test as opposed to a whole class of tests.

For example, say you have a tests.php file that contains a FileWriter_Test_Class with a test method named testFileWriter that you want to run.

Do this:

```
phpunit --filter testFileWriter FileWriter_Test_Class tests.php
```
