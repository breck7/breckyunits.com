 grepðŸ”—./use-grep-to-search-multiple-files-at-once.html is to find what sed is to replace.

paragraph
 Say you noticed a few typos in a file. Say you typed imposible instead of impossible a few times in a file named "stuff.txt".

paragraph
 You can fix all occurrences using this one-liner:

code
 sed 's/imposible/impossible/g' stuff.txt

paragraph
 Often it's more helpful to sed across multiple files.

code
 sed -i 's/1.0.1/"1.0.1"/g' *.php

paragraph
 That's one command I used to add quotes around 1.0.1, which I forgot to do. Alas, it's not recursive.
