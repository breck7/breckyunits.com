Shortcut for switching to a Windows directory in Cygwin
=======================================================
January 1, 2010

In cygwin it can be a pain to change to a Windows directory like `C:\Users\breck\Documents\My Dropbox`.

I made a small bash script called `wcd` that makes it easier.

wcd
===

```
#!/bin/bash
echo $1
newpath=$(echo $1 | sed 's|\\|/|g' | sed 's|:||g' | sed 's|^C|/cygdrive/c|')
echo $newpath
cd "$newpath"
```

The echos are just for debugging--I'm kind of new to bash scripting. Feel free to remove.

Make this file executable and add an alias into your bash_profile:

```
alias wcd="source ~/wcd"
```

Now you can just type(or actually copy/paste) something like this:

```
wcd "C:\Users\breck\Documents\My Dropbox"
```

...and that will take you to the Windows directory.
