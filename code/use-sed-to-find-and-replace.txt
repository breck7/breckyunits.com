Use sed to find and replace
===========================
December 20, 2009

`grep` is to find what `sed` is to replace.

Say you noticed a few typos in a file. Say you typed imposible instead of impossible a few times in a file named "stuff.txt".

You can fix all occurrences using this one-liner:

```
sed 's/imposible/impossible/g' stuff.txt
```

Often it's more helpful to sed across multiple files.

```
sed -i 's/1.0.1/"1.0.1"/g' *.php
```

That's one command I used to add quotes around 1.0.1, which I forgot to do. Alas, it's not recursive.
