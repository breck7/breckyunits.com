vim macros
==========
March 9, 2010

Let's say you want to add comments to your php functions following the conventional format:

/**
* Returns the sum of 2 variables.
*
* @param int $a
* @param int $b
* @return int $sum
*/
function sum($a, $b)
{
$sum = $a + $b;
return $sum;
}

You can record a macro to help speed up the commenting process.

Just type `q` followed by the letter you want to assign the macro to (in this case let's use `c`), type your keystrokes, then hit `q` again to stop recording. Now hit `c` to replay your macro.

You can overwrite the macro by repeating the above steps.

Bonus tip:

*Bookmarks*.Use `m` + a letter to create a bookmark in vim. Then use the backtick plus the letter to return to the location.

*Keyword completion*. Use `Ctrl+N` to complete a word.
