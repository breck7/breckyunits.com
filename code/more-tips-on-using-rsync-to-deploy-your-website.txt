More tips on using rsync to deploy your website
===============================================
February 3, 2010

My post on <a href="use-rsync-to-deploy-your-website.html">deploying a website using rsync</a> has gotten quite a few hits.

I thought I'd add some more tips:

- use the "--delete" option if you want to delete files on the destination directory that no longer exist in the source directory.
- add "$1" after your options like this:

```
rsync -rvz$1
```

Then you can easily do a DRY RUN. Just type:

```
./deploy.sh n
```

The n will get substituted for $1.

Troubleshooting
===============

I've found a lot of times rsync appears to be copying the same files over and over.

There are a few things you can do to troubleshoot <a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/FAQ.html">when rsync recopies the same files</a>.

The options that I've found come in real handy are:

- 1. The <b>i</b> option, which shows you why a file is being copied (all pluses means rsync thinks it doesn't exist in the destination; t means the times differ; s means the contents differ (?)).
- 2. The <b>--modify-window=1</b> option. This lets you ignore differences in modified timestamps. You can set 1 to a high number to ignore large differences.
