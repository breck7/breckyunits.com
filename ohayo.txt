Ohayo
=====

June 23, 2017

I just pushed a project I've been working on called Ohayo.
 https://ohayo.breckyunits.com

You can also view it on GitHub: https://github.com/treenotation/ohayo

I wanted to try and make a fast, visual app for doing data science. I can't quite recommend it yet, but I think it might get there. If you are interested you can try it now.
