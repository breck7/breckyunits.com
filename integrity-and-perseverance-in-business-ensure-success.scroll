* _Preface: Richard Brhel of placepeep shared a great quote the other day on StartupSchool. He saw the quote on a poster years ago when he was helping a digitization effort in Ohio. I had never seen this exact quote before so wanted to transcribe it for the web._

In 1851 Ezekiel G. Folsom incorporated Folsom's Mercantile College in Ohio. Folsom's taught bookkeeping, banking, and _"railroading"_, amongst other things.

The image above is a screenshot of an 1850's poster promoting the college. The poster includes a motto (which I boxed in green) that I think is great guidance:

quote
 Integrity and Perseverance in Business ensure success

? Guess who went to Folsom's and presumably saw this poster and was influenced by this motto?
