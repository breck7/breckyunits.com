title How James Park built FitBit

date 2021-03-11

title4 Introduction

paragraph
 First off, if you don't have a FitBit
 yet, go <a
 href="https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/smartwatches">buy yourself a
 Versa 3</a>. For less than one dollar per day you can start to
 build your own long-term personal health dataset to learn what
 strategies work for you. From what I hear, Garmin
 and Apple make good ones too, but FitBit is what I know
 best.

paragraph
 With that PSA out of the way, let me explain what
 this is. Guy Raz does an amazing interview show on NPR
 called <a
 href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this">How I Built This</a>.
 In this <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/22/841267648/fitbit-james-park">episode</a> he interviews James Park who
 explains the
 story of FitBit. As a huge fan of FitBit and startups, I
 found this to be an amazing story and so used Rev.com to 
 help make the transcript below. Subtitles (and all mistakes)
 added by me.

title2 Transcript of <em>How I Built This</em> with James Park

paragraph
 Guy Raz(🎙): From NPR, It's How I Built This. A show about innovators,
 entrepreneurs, idealists, and the stories behind the movements. Here
 we go. I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, how the Nintendo Wii
 inspired James Park to build a device and then a company that would
 have a huge and lasting influence on the health and fitness industry,
 Fitbit. It's taken me a few weeks to get motivated about exercise.
 This whole pandemic thing just had me in a state of anxiety and it
 messed with my routine, but I was inspired to jump back into it about
 two weeks ago, after watching my 11-year-old proudly announce his
 daily step count recorded on his Fitbit. Now, fitness isn't all that
 important to him. He's 11. But the gamification of fitness, the idea
 that it could be fun to hit 5,000 or 10,000 steps a day, that's what
 matters.

paragraph
 🎙: This is the stroke of insight James Park had soon after he
 stood in line at a Best Buy in San Francisco to buy the brand new
 video game system called Nintendo Wii. And you'll hear James explain
 the story a bit later, but what he realized playing the Wii is that
 you could actually change human behavior around exercise if you turned
 it into a game. And the thing is, up until James Park and his
 co-founder Eric Friedman founded Fitbit in 2007, there really weren't
 any digital fitness trackers that were designed that way. It took a
 few years for James and Eric to gain traction, but by 2010, 2011,
 Fitbit took off. At one point, their fitness devices accounted for
 nearly 70% of the market. And by 2015, the company was valued at more
 than $10 billion. But that same year, the Apple Watch was released,
 and Fitbit and its market share got hammered. When I spoke to James
 Park a few days ago, he was in San Francisco, living in an Airbnb.

paragraph
 James Park(⌚️): I'm in a temporary Airbnb because the place that I
 typically live in has been flooded out by a malfunctioning washing
 machine. I woke up at it 1:00 AM

paragraph
 🎙: In the middle of this whole thing, flooded
 washing machine went... You woke up in the middle of the night and
 there was water everywhere?

paragraph
 ⌚️: I know. Amazing timing. Yeah. I woke up at 1:00 AM, and I
 just woke up to the sound of water gushing everywhere. It was coming
 through the ceiling. It was a massive flood.

paragraph
 🎙: Okay. So on top of sheltering in place and running his
 company remotely, James had to move out of his apartment in the middle
 of the night and then set up the microphone and gear we sent him for
 this interview. He started to tell us about his parents who immigrated
 from Korea when James was four. Back in Korea, his dad had been an
 electrical engineer and his mom was a nurse. But as with many
 immigrants, they had a hard time getting those same jobs in the US. So
 instead, his parents became small business owners.

title3 Growing Up (1977)

paragraph
 ⌚️: The first conscious memory I have is, my parents actually
 own the wig shop in downtown Cleveland.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow. How did they get into that? Was it just a way to earn a
 living?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. I think a way to earn a living and the typical
 immigrant story is you have friends who live in the country that
 you're immigrating to. And I think my dad had a friend who worked in
 wig wholesaling. That's where he started out. There were selling wigs
 to people who live in downtown Cleveland, African-Americans, mostly
 women. And I remember my mom, she'd spend a lot of time just looking
 through black fashion magazine, styling hair, beating them, et cetera.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow.

paragraph
 ⌚️: They had a wig shop, dry cleaners, a fish market. At one
 point we moved to Atlanta and they ran an ice cream shop there. We
 sold track suits, starter jackets, fitted baseball caps, thick gold
 chains.

paragraph
 🎙: Sort of hip-hop urban wear, right? Like FUBU, and stuff like
 that?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. Yeah. Yep. They sold FUBU jeans. Yep. I remember
 that. And they could switch from one genre or one type of business to
 another and really not skip a beat.

paragraph
 🎙: And were your parents, did they expect you perform well at
 school? Was that just a given?

paragraph
 ⌚️: I think they had incredibly high expectations then as a
 kid. I think I remember my mom telling me when I was pretty young, I
 don't know, five, six, seven, that she expected me to go to Harvard.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. I don't think I quite knew what that meant back
 then, but you could tell that their expectations were pretty high from
 the very beginning.

title3 Dropping out of Harvard (1998)

paragraph
 🎙: James did in fact meet his mom's expectations. He did go to
 Harvard. He put in three years studying computer science, but after
 his junior year, he got a summer internship at Morgan Stanley and then
 ended up deciding to start his own business. And then we had hoped to
 finish his college degree, he never went back.

paragraph
 ⌚️: I always had a little bit of a stubborn streak, and that
 was when I was trying to figure things out, try to think of ideas. I
 think there is a lot of opportunity, a lot of problems to be solved. I
 was also looking for a co-founder at the time. So those are two
 critical ingredients, an idea and a co-founder.

paragraph
 🎙: This is 1998. This is not 2015 when these kinds of
 conversations seem so common. This was unusual in 1998 for a young
 person. It was just less common for a young person to just sort of
 say, "I'm going to look into a tech startup and try to find a
 co-founder and just take some time to think about these things." I
 would imagine your parents were nervous. I'd be nervous if my
 20-year-old said to me, "I'm not going to go back to college and I
 don't really know what I'm going to do, but I'm just going to think
 about it."

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. They were understandably pretty upset, angry even
 I'd say. And the irony is that, they probably took away more
 incredible personal risk moving from Korea to United States and
 running these series of businesses, which are commonly done, but not
 easy in themselves and pretty high risk. But I do understand obviously
 the perspective at the time.

title3 The eCommerce Start Up

paragraph
 🎙: Okay. You decide you want to start something up, and I think
 you eventually landed on e-commerce, right?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. That was not a groundbreaking thing at the time.
 Obviously, Amazon was around, et cetera. A lot of e-commerce startups,
 but settled on this idea of making e-commerce a lot more seamless and
 frictionless and came up at this idea of a electronic wallet that
 would automatically make purchases for you. It would work with a lot
 of different e-commerce sites and the goal there was that we would
 take a cut of every transaction.

paragraph
 🎙: Right. And what was the company called?

paragraph
 ⌚️: That was interesting. We originally named it Kapoof, that
 was how it was incorporated, until a lot of people said, "That might
 not be the best name for a company." Sounds like, we called it Kapoof
 because it sounded like magic, et cetera, Kapoof. Things are done.
 Your transaction is completed by Kapoof.

paragraph
 🎙: It sounds like, "Kapoof, your money is gone."

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah, exactly.

paragraph
 🎙: "You've no more money."

paragraph
 ⌚️: Exactly. Time of crazy names like Yahoo, et cetera. But we
 decided to change our name at some point and we changed it to Epesi,
 which was so Swahili for fast. And so that was the ultimate name of
 the company.

title3 Raising a "few million" dollars

paragraph
 🎙: And you guys were actually able to raise a fair amount of
 money. Right?

paragraph
 ⌚️: We did. We ended up raising a few million dollars from
 some individuals and some from some venture capital firms as well. And
 we hired some people. We found a cool renovated firehouse. That was-

paragraph
 🎙: Nice. Nice

paragraph
 ⌚️: ... Really amazing place to hang out in for many, many,
 many hours of the day. And we hired up to, it was close to about 30
 people.

title3 Meeting his eventual FitBit cofounder

paragraph
 🎙: Wow. One super important thing that happened there was you
 met Eric Friedman, right? The guy that you would eventually launch
 Fitbit with.

paragraph
 ⌚️: I did. And that's probably one of the more fortunate turns
 in my life. Eric, we didn't know each other at all before the company,
 Epesi. He was actually just graduating from Yale in computer science.
 And I interviewed him. I liked him a lot. And he ended up ultimately
 becoming the first employee at the company.

paragraph
 🎙: Okay. So you hire Eric, and I think the company lasted 18
 months, or a little less than two years.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. About two years, and a lot of ups and downs during
 that period. If I had to think back, I would attribute two-thirds of
 the challenges and problems we faced as a business to myself, just
 because I had never managed people. I didn't really know how to run a
 business, even it was only the technology side. And at some point the
 dot-com crash happened. And all of our potential customers, the whole
 industry, the whole economy started taking a downturn.

title3 Dot Com Bust (2001)

paragraph
 🎙: So this company spirals out in 2001. And when that happened,
 did you think, "Okay, I should go back to college now and finish my
 degree." Or, "I got to start something else." Where was your head at
 that point?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Well, it was a really challenging personal time for me.
 Towards the end of the company, we obviously had to lay off most of
 the company, and trying to doing it in a way that was compassionate
 was really, really difficult. I don't think the thought of entering
 school or going back to school popped back into my head at all. And I
 don't know why. I think it was because, despite this very emotional
 failure, I knew this was what I wanted to do. I had a firm conviction
 about that. And so I knew I wasn't going to go back.

paragraph
 🎙: So what'd you do?

title3 Getting Real Jobs

paragraph
 ⌚️: We all ended up working at the same place actually. It was
 a company, a pretty large company called Dun & Bradstreet at the time.
 Very stable company. And we were all fortunate to be able to find work
 there as engineers.

paragraph
 🎙: So daytime working at Dun & Bradstreet, and then what? At
 night sitting around just-

paragraph
 ⌚️: Brainstorming. Yeah. We go into work during the daytime
 and then we'd come home in the evenings, code different things, try
 different things out. So it was a pretty intense.
 I think, in terms of the numbers of hours, I don't think anything
 changed from our first startup to trying to figure this next one out.

title3 Startup #2 (2002)

paragraph
 🎙: And before too long, you decide to do another startup. This
 time, with Eric Friedman from your previous company, and then another
 guy named Gokhan Kutlu. I think this was what? 2003, 2004?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. This was about 2002 actually.

paragraph
 🎙: Okay. And this time the startup was a photo editing platform,
 sharing platform. What was it called?

paragraph
 ⌚️: The company's name at the time was called HeyPix and the
 product itself was called electric shoe box because a lot of people
 put their old photos in shoe boxes and this was just going to be a
 digital.

paragraph
 🎙: Yes. I still have them in shoe boxes.

paragraph
 ⌚️: You'll digitize them probably.

paragraph
 🎙: I should. I know.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. And so electric shoe box, which is going to be a
 digital version of your shoe box.

paragraph
 🎙: And what could you do?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Well, there are digital cameras were coming about back
 then. It still wasn't easy to connect them, upload photos. It was
 getting easier, but nowhere near what it is today, obviously. The
 whole idea of electric shoe box was to make the whole process of
 getting photos off your camera a lot easier. And more importantly, we
 wanted to make the process of sharing these photos with your friends
 and family a lot easier.

paragraph
 🎙: So did you raise money for the product, for the electric shoe
 box?

paragraph
 ⌚️: We did. We ended up raising money primarily from one of my
 friends from middle school who was a mutual fund manager in Boston.
 And so, he put in a bit of money, not a lot. I think about, at least
 for him, it was about 100,000. And we had a bunch of savings ourselves
 that we were going to use. And in anticipation, I also opened up a few
 more credit cards as well.

paragraph
 🎙: And it was just really the three of you, sitting at your
 computers and just tapping the keys all night?

paragraph
 ⌚️: You pretty much nailed it. I mean, all we did was, we
 would wake up in the morning, walk over to the third bedroom and just
 start typing away for 12 hours. We'd take meal breaks. I remember Eric
 did a lot of cooking. So we'd eat our dinners on some TV stands
 watching TV. That was a good break for us, watching Seinfeld, and then
 go to bed and then repeat it the following day.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow. All right. So you come up with this product, and by the
 way, how are you going to make money off of this thing? This is a free
 service. How were you going to pay for it?

paragraph
 ⌚️: I guess, it would be called freemium software. It would be
 free for a period of time, and the trial period would end and then
 you'd have to submit your credit card information to continue using
 the software.

paragraph
 🎙: Got it. Got it.


title3 The pivotal $300 Press Release

paragraph
 ⌚️: And so, our primary goal was making sure that a lot of
 people knew about the software. So we put it on shareware sites, et
 cetera. And then we spent a lot of time debating, "Should we send out
 a press release?" And I remember it was a huge debate because sending
 out a press release was going to be about $300. And that was the level
 of expense that required a vigorous debate at the time. So we said,
 "You know what? Without getting the product known, how are we going to
 be successful?" So we wrote up a press release and we put it out. And
 actually it was probably the most pivotal decision we ever made in
 that company's history.

paragraph
 🎙: Because?

paragraph
 ⌚️: The first email came in a few hours later. I think the
 second one came in a day later. But we got two emails, one from CNET,
 which is a huge digital publishing company. And then we got another
 email from Yahoo saying, "Hey, we just heard about this launch of this
 software product. And we'd like to talk to you guys more about it."

paragraph
 🎙: Wow.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Exactly. This was coming from their corporate development
 arms, which typically deals with M&A, with buying, buying companies.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah, exactly. We were like, "Whoa, this is magic. How did
 this happen?"

title3 Bought by CNET for millions (2005)

paragraph
 🎙: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111265965498397840">2005, it gets purchased by CNET</a>. They make an offer to buy
 this company, buy this product from you guys and you sell it to CNET.
 Was that life-changing money? Did that mean that you never had to work
 again?

paragraph
 ⌚️: It was definitely a good acquisition for all of us at the
 time. Remember we were three guys working out of our apartments. I was
 at the time about $40,000 in credit card debt as well. We were down to
 some desperate times and we were negotiating numbers and they threw
 out a number which was, their first offer was 4 million, and we were
 like, "Whoa, that's amazing."

paragraph
 🎙: Wow.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Like, "God, I can't believe we built something that's
 worth this much at the time." We were just stunned. And then, we
 quickly got to, "Okay, how do we negotiate something better?"

paragraph
 🎙: So you sell your company to CNET in 2005 and you've got some
 money in your pocket. And you move to San Francisco to work for CNET.
 Did you enjoy it? I mean, it was probably a huge company at this
 point, right?

paragraph
 ⌚️: It was a huge company, but I think the moment, at least
 for me, that I moved to San Francisco, I instantly fell in love with
 the city. And CNET, even though was a larger company, I actually found
 it to be an amazing time. I learned a lot. I got some management
 training. I ended up managing a small team of people. Learned a lot
 about how technology scales to millions and millions of users. How you
 market products. I really enjoyed my experience there. I think it was
 pretty formative.

title3 Nintendo Wii and Leaving CNET (2007)

paragraph
 🎙: Why did you leave CNET?

paragraph
 ⌚️: We left CNET just because of, I guess you could call it a
 bolt of lightning in some ways. It was December of 2006 and Nintendo
 had just announced the Nintendo Wii. And I remember coming home,
 putting it together. At the time Nintendo had come up with this really
 innovative control system, using motion sensors, accelerometers to
 serve as inputs into a game. And after using it, especially in Wii
 Fit, which was a sports game. I thought, "Wow, this is incredible.
 This is amazing. This is magical. You can use sensors in this way. You
 can use it to bring people together." Particularly for Wii Fit, it was
 a way of getting people active, of getting them moving together. And I
 was just blown away by this whole idea, really excited about. I
 couldn't stop thinking about it.

paragraph
 ⌚️: And after some time of playing Wii Fit and the Wii and a
 lot of other games, I thought, "This is great. It's in my living room,
 but what if I want to take this outside of the living room?" And I
 kept thinking about that idea, like-

paragraph
 🎙: "How do you take Wii Fit outside?"

paragraph
 ⌚️: Outside. Exactly.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow.

title3 The Genesis of Fitbit (2007)

paragraph
 ⌚️: I couldn't let it go. And I ultimately ended up calling up
 Eric and we started talking about this idea for hours and hours and we
 couldn't stop talking about it. It's like, "How do we capture this
 magic and make it more portable? How do we give it to people 24-7?"
 And that was really the Genesis of Fitbit.

paragraph
 🎙: So the technology, I mean, pedometers have been around
 forever. Was that where your head was going, or thinking, "Okay, maybe
 we just create an electronic pedometer?" But I think even electronic
 pedometers were around in 2007, right?

title3 Existing Pedometers

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. Pedometers were definitely around back then.
 Actually, they had been around for probably 100 years. One of the
 things though is that, they weren't something that people would want
 to use or to wear. They were very big. They were pretty ugly. They
 looked like medical devices.

paragraph
 🎙: A lot of senior citizens used them.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. They weren't a very aspirational device. It wasn't
 something that people were excited to use. And so, I think that's why
 that whole category of device just never really had any innovation.
 And there are also much higher-end devices. You could buy much fancier
 running watches, like GPS watches, et cetera. But those are really
 expensive for people. There are 300, $400 at the time.

paragraph
 🎙: So you had this idea, and that means you had to raise money.
 And this is going to be the third time now that you've had to do that
 for a business. And I think I read that you raised $400,000 to launch
 this. I mean, I don't know a lot about hardware, but that doesn't seem
 like it was going to take you very far in building a physical product.

paragraph
 ⌚️: As we quickly found out, yes, we had grossly
 underestimated the cost of taking this to market.

paragraph
 🎙: And what did that initial amount of money, how far did they
 get you into actually conceding of what this product was going to be?

paragraph
 ⌚️: It got us to a prototype, write some rudimentary software,
 get some industrial design concepts done and some models.

paragraph
 🎙: What did the prototype look like? Did it look like a Fitbit?

paragraph
 ⌚️: It looked absolutely nothing like a Fitbit. There are two
 things, there was actual, somewhat working prototype and then there
 was an industrial design model.

paragraph
 🎙: Which was a piece of plastic.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Plastic, and metal that was supposed to look like the
 ultimate product. And so, that actually looked really, really nice.

paragraph
 🎙: But it didn't work?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. It was totally nonfunctional. And we'd always have
 to tell people before showing, "This doesn't work here." Because they
 get all excited looking at the model. "No, no, no. That doesn't work."
 The thing that actually worked looked like something that came out of
 a garage, literally.

paragraph
 🎙: What did it look like?

title3 The prototype

paragraph
 ⌚️: It was rectangular circuit board, a little bit smaller
 than your. And it had a motion sensor, it had a
 radio, it had a microcontroller, which was the brains of the product.
 And it had a rudimentary case, which was a balsa with box.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow. So you would take to investors, a circuit board and a
 balsa wood box as your prototype?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. That was the prototype. And actually that was what
 we had demoed. When we first announced the company, that was the
 prototype that was actually being used at the announcement.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow. I mean, how did you even get it to that point? Because
 you guys are both software engineers, how did you develop a physical
 product that even such a crude prototype could track movement? Did you
 have other people help you do that?

paragraph
 ⌚️: That was our big task was to find the right people who
 could help us. I knew the founder of a really great industrial design
 firm in San Francisco called <a href="https://www.newdealdesign.com/">New Deal Design</a>. His name is Gadi Amit.
 And then on the algorithm side, because it was going to take a lot of
 sophisticated algorithms to translate this motion data to actual data
 that users would be able to understand, I ended up asking my best
 friend from college, because he was in grad
 school at Harvard at the time. And he said, "Wait, I think I might
 know somebody." And it ended up being his teaching fellow, his name
 was Shelton. And we talked and I was like, "Wow, this guy is super
 smart. We need to get him working on the algorithms." So he ended up
 working on the side while doing his PHD, helping us out with a lot of
 the software.

paragraph
 🎙: I mean, you leave CNET in 2007, and you've got 400,000 to
 come up with a prototype that quickly run out of that. So it's 2008,
 and you're trying to raise money, how much did you raise?

title3 Raising $2M (2008)

paragraph
 ⌚️: I think our first round was about $2 million.

paragraph
 🎙: Which was not going to take you that far if you wanted to
 develop a physical product that was super sophisticated, a piece of
 hardware.

paragraph
 ⌚️: We thought we could do it. We thought we knew a little bit
 more about the hardware business. We put together another business
 plan budget. It was actually a pretty challenging time to raise money
 as well because-

paragraph
 🎙: Oh, with the financial crisis. Yeah.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Exactly. It was the fall of 2008, when we were trying to
 raise money. One of the, I guess the good and bad things about VCs is,
 the good thing about VCs is they're incredibly healthy people. They're
 super fit. But it also made it difficult for a lot of them to
 understand the value of the product because what we were trying to do
 was, it wasn't a product meant for super athletic people, it was
 really meant to help normal people become more active, become
 healthier, et cetera. And it was hard for a lot of them to grasp why
 that was valuable. They'd ask, "Well, did it do X or did it do Y and
 did it do Z?" And we'd say, "No, it doesn't do any of that." And so it
 was very difficult for a lot of these super-fit VCs to understand the
 value of the product, even though a lot of them claim they don't try
 to put their own bias on these products. It's naturally human to do
 that.

paragraph
 🎙: And did you know right away that this was going to be... I
 mean, now Fitbit's are watches mainly. They're wrists, there on your
 wrist. But at that time, you were thinking that this was just going to
 be something you would clip to your clothing?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. Something to clip to your clothing for men. And then
 what we found out in talking to a lot of women was that they wanted to
 tuck it away somewhere hidden. They didn't want people to see it. And
 we said, "Okay, where would you want to put it?" And said, "Well, a
 lot of our pants don't have pockets, so it can't be in our pocket."
 And so the preferred place was actually on their bra. So a lot of the
 physical design that we had to think about in the early days was how
 to come up with a product that would be very slim, slender, and
 clipped people's bra.

paragraph
 🎙: And hidden.

paragraph
 ⌚️: And hidden and clipped the bras pretty easily.

paragraph
 🎙: And by the way, how did you come up with the name Fitbit?

title3 Buying FitBit.com from a Russian for $2,000

paragraph
 ⌚️: It's never easy to name a company, and it's even more
 challenging just because of domain names. That's typically a lot of
 the limiting factor in naming a great company. And so, we would spend
 hours and hours and days just going through different permutations of
 names, and some awful ones as well. At some point we got onto a fruit
 theme. So we were thinking like Fitberry or Berryfit or Fitcado. Just
 some really awful names.

paragraph
 🎙: The Fitcado.

paragraph
 ⌚️: The Fitcado. Yes. History might've turned out a lot
 differently for sure. I was just taking a nap in my office one
 afternoon. I think I was actually napping on the rug because I was so
 tired. And I woke up and it just hit me, it was Fitbit. And the next
 challenge was actually the domain name. The domain name was not
 available. And it was owned by the guy in Russia. And I'm like, "Oh my
 god, how are we going to get this domain name? We'll just email the
 guy and see what happens." And he said, "Well, how much are you
 willing to offer?" And I said, "Oh god, I don't know. How about 1,000
 bucks?" And he's like, "Oof, how about 10,000?" And I said, "Oh, I
 don't know. That sounds like a lot. How about 2,000?" And he's like,
 "Oh, okay. 2000, deal." I think it was literally two or three emails
 that we sent back and forth in this negotiation.

paragraph
 🎙: Probably the best $2,000 you ever spent in your life, except
 for the 300 you spent on the press release a couple years earlier.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah, yeah. Definitely a good return.

paragraph
 🎙: You've probably spent many millions of dollars on other
 things in your life that were not as good of a deal as that $2,000.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. It's tens of thousands on naming consultants and
 focus groups and trademark searches and all of that. It's kind of
 funny.

paragraph
 🎙: Hey, as they say, small companies, small problems, big
 company, big problems.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Exactly.

title3 Doing a consumer hardware startup before KickStarter

paragraph
 🎙: So where do you begin? I mean, you got to make it, you got to
 find a factory, you got to find designers. Where do you go?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Very good question. We obviously had zero connections. The
 challenge though, was not actually the connections to the
 manufacturers, but finding a manufacturer who we could actually
 convince to build this product because we didn't have a background in
 hardware. And so, would they actually want to work with us? That was
 the biggest concern at the time.

paragraph
 🎙: So how did you find them?

paragraph
 ⌚️: We went out to China. We went out to Singapore. And we
 were never going to be able to get the Foxconn's.

paragraph
 🎙: You had to go to a smaller place.

paragraph
 ⌚️: We had to go to a smaller place, who'd be more nimble,
 more flexible, who'd want to take a financial risk. And we finally
 found a great manufacturer based in Singapore called Racer
 Technologies. And the good thing is actually, it was the best of all
 worlds, the headquarters was in Singapore. Most of the management team
 and the engineering staff was in Singapore, but they had manufacturing
 facilities that were in Indonesia. The labor there was going to be
 lower cost than in Singapore.

paragraph
 🎙: All right. So 2008, you've got the name Fitbit, you go to
 <a href="https://youtu.be/RRR26GPpQ4A?t=218">TechCrunch to present</a>, to unveil this product. And what was the
 product that you were offering? Well, you said, "All right, we've got
 to think of the Fitbit and it does this." What did you say it did at
 that point?

<a href="https://youtu.be/RRR26GPpQ4A?t=218"><img src="fitbit2008.png" /></a>

paragraph
 ⌚️: Our pitch to the crowd at TechCrunch, and ultimately to
 our consumer was that, it was a product that would track your steps,
 distance, calories, and how much you slept and would answer some basic
 questions about your health, "Was I active enough today? Did I get
 enough sleep? What do I need to do to lose weight," et cetera. And one
 of the more important aspects was this idea of a community as well.
 "Join other people who own Fitbits, your friends and family, and you
 could compete with each other." And it was all wireless. You didn't
 really have to do anything. All you'd have to do is wear this device,
 don't even think about it, and all this magic would happen. That was
 the promise of Fitbit at the time.

paragraph
 🎙: There was a lot of excitement there, but I'm wondering, were
 you nervous to do these presentations? Did you have to prepare like
 crazy, or did you just find your ability to be this person you had to
 be on stage when you got up there?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah, I think there was no other choice. It was just
 something we had to do. And I think-

paragraph
 🎙: Are you better at it than Eric, or is Eric better at it than
 you?

paragraph
 ⌚️: I think we're both good in our different ways. It just
 fell upon me. I don't even know how we decide those things. But
 actually, what was running through our minds, was not what we were
 going to say and how we're going to say it, but whether the demo would
 actually work on stage, because again, it was a little sketchy. It was
 still very early. It was still in the wooden box.

paragraph
 🎙: In the balsa wood box.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Balsa wood box phase. So we were just worried that the
 demo would just fail or crash.

paragraph
 🎙: But it worked.

title3 The TechCrunch pitch and 2,000 preorders

paragraph
 ⌚️: It worked, and actually it did crash in the middle of the
 presentation because the whole demo was about me walking on stage, the
 device would be collecting stats. And at one point I would turn to
 Eric and say, "Hey, Eric, why don't you refresh the page and show that
 all the stats have been uploaded." Magically, do this wireless
 connection. And so, the demo actually crashed while I was talking, and
 Eric was fiercely trying to reboot his computer during this period and
 I don't even know anything about it. But ultimately, the demo did
 work. And so, to many people, it seemed like magic. Literally, people
 started clapping. It was really amazing.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Originally, right before TechCrunch, Eric and I, we made
 just a verbal bet. "How many pre-orders are we going to get after this
 conference when we announce and make the company public?" And I think
 Eric said, "I think we'll get like five pre-orders." So it's like,
 "The device isn't even available. People are going to have to give us
 their credit card information." And I said, "Nah, you know what? I'm
 not as pessimistic. I think there's going to be like 10, 15, 20." And
 so we got off stage, and by the end of the day, we had about 2000
 pre-orders.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow. When we come back in just a moment, James and Eric have
 a prototype in the balsa wood box and they don't exactly know how they
 are going to get from there to filling thousands of pre-orders. But a
 lot of people are expecting them in time for Christmas. Stay with us,

paragraph
 🎙: Hey, welcome back to How I Built This from NPR, I'm guy Raz.
 So it's 2008, and James and his co-founder Eric Friedman show off
 their Fitbit prototype at TechCrunch, and it makes a huge splash. The
 problem is, they have no finished product. They haven't even figured
 out how they're going to make it and pre-orders are pouring in.

title3 Being Open and Transparent

paragraph
 ⌚️: And they just kept coming in. It was crazy. We were like,
 "Oh my god, it's not just dozens of these units we have to build, it's
 now thousands, and more and more every day." And so we were still
 thinking Christmas of that year that we were going to start shipping
 out units, and it rapidly became clear to us that we weren't going to
 make Christmas. And so, we're thinking, "Okay, how do we keep all
 these people happy while we pull this off?" So this was before
 Kickstarter and Indiegogo and all that. We had to improvise. We were
 like, "Okay, why don't we just blog about the whole process and just
 be very open and transparent about it." So we started a blog, and I
 wrote maybe weekly updates on how things were going, challenges and
 delays that we were facing.

paragraph
 ⌚️: And I was really surprised, actually, it worked. It made
 people understand what we were going through. They're literally seeing
 the thing being made, the sausage being made behind the scenes. And I
 think that kept people really engaged throughout the process.

paragraph
 🎙: So you have basically a bunch of contractors and freelancers
 and you guys are going back and forth to Asia. You got people working
 on the software to transmit the data to the web. You've got some
 people working on the hardware, presumably, in Singapore trying shrink
 down the motherboard to something that is two inches by one half inch.
 And were you just constantly running into failures? You would think
 that, "Oh, here it is." And then somebody would hit the go button and
 then it would just fizzle out, it wouldn't work?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. I can't even enumerate the number of challenges with
 the product that we had.

paragraph
 🎙: Please start.

title3 Manufacturing in Asia

paragraph
 ⌚️: In some ways a lot of people, I think when you think about
 hardware, it's like, "Oh, I'll find a manufacturer in China. I'll
 throw over a design."

paragraph
 🎙: Yeah, right. No problem.

paragraph
 ⌚️: "They'll just run with it."

paragraph
 🎙: And then, "Just send me the bill," and then it's done.

paragraph
 ⌚️: And they'll just crank out thousands, tens of thousands of
 this. But that's never-

paragraph
 🎙: And that works if it's a suitcase, we've done a way. It works
 if it's that thing.

paragraph
 ⌚️: If it's that thing or something that's very similar to
 something that they've built before.

paragraph
 🎙: Right.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Well, that's a different story than this thing that this
 manufacturer never had built before.

paragraph
 🎙: So they would send you things and say, "Yep, we got it." And
 then you would get it and it sucked. It just didn't work.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. We wouldn't wait for them to send it. I mean, either
 myself or Eric would be in Indonesia or Singapore at any given time.
 We'd trade off different weeks. And we were out there on the
 production lines pretty much inspecting every part of the process.

paragraph
 🎙: But were you convinced this thing was going to work or did
 you have doubt?

paragraph
 ⌚️: I was absolutely convinced that it was going to happen.

paragraph
 🎙: You had no doubts that this-

paragraph
 ⌚️: I had no doubts because we were getting proof every day
 that this was something that was going to be big. And I think the
 first evidence of that was at TechCrunch where we had 2,000 pre-orders
 and we were getting pre-orders every day. I think by the summer time,
 we had about 25,000 pre-orders at $100 per unit. That's a fair amount
 of revenue if we could ship these units.

paragraph
 🎙: And how much was it going to cost you to make each unit?

paragraph
 ⌚️: That was a very good question. We didn't know that.
 Hopefully, under $100.

paragraph
 🎙: You didn't know? You were selling them for $100, but you
 didn't know how much it was going to cost you.

paragraph
 ⌚️: We had a sense of the bill of materials. I think we were
 trying to shoot for a gross margin of about 50%. So we're targeting
 the full cost of the product, including shipping, et cetera, being no
 more than $50. That's what we were targeting.

paragraph
 🎙: Which is a lot. That's high. It's a high cost.

paragraph
 ⌚️: It's a high cost, but that was a cost at which we felt we
 could sustain ourselves as a business.

paragraph
 🎙: How did you and Eric manage your relationship and friendship?
 I mean, with the stress of this delay and inability to meet demand and
 all these, was there tension at all between the two of you, or you
 guys totally are on the same page?

title3 Importance of cofounders

paragraph
 ⌚️: I don't think there was that much tension. I mean, a lot
 of stress, but not tension. I think we trust in our ability to help
 each other out. And there are periods when either of us would be
 pretty down on the company and the product. And luckily, we weren't
 down both at the same time. And that's why it helps, I think, to have
 a co-founder.

paragraph
 🎙: So there were times where you were really down and he could
 give you a pep talk and.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Exactly. And then I'd wonder why he wasn't down. And
 there're some pretty dark times right before we shipped. I remember we
 were months before we thought we could finally get the first unit off
 the production line. And I was sitting in my hotel room in Singapore,
 and I was testing out one of the prototype builds that that Racer had
 produced and the radio range was not good at all. It was supposed to
 have a range-

title3 Hardware is Hard

paragraph
 🎙: 10 feet or 15 feet?

paragraph
 ⌚️: That was the hope that it would have 15 to 20 feet range,
 but the range was actually two inches.

paragraph
 🎙: Oh god. Wait, so the antenna in the device had a two inch
 range.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. It would only work at two inches. And I'm thinking,
 we've got to ship this holiday season. I've got tens of thousands of
 these people waiting.

paragraph
 🎙: Oh god.

paragraph
 ⌚️: And so, I'm just freaking out in hotel room.

paragraph
 🎙: You might as well have a cord and just plug it in.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Exactly, exactly. I couldn't sleep that night obviously.
 And I took the unit apart. I had a multimeter and I was measuring
 different voltages and currents. And what I realized was, huh, the
 cable for the display was flexible and long enough that maybe it was
 actually trooping down and touching the antenna and that was causing-

paragraph
 🎙: That was creating interference.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Creating interference. And I could see that when you put
 the whole thing together, that it might troop down. And I thought,
 "Okay, how do I create a shim that would prop the antenna?" So I went
 to the bathroom, grabbed some toilet paper, rolled a little bit of it
 in a ball and stuffed it between the antenna and the display cable,
 put the device back together. And it started working. The range was
 great.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow. So you had to separate one wire from the antenna and
 that was it, with toilet paper?

paragraph
 ⌚️: With toilet paper. Yeah, that was it.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow.

paragraph
 ⌚️: And I still couldn't sleep. So as early as possible, the
 following morning I raced into our manufacturing and said, "Okay, I
 think I found the problem," but obviously a toilet paper is not a
 scalable high volume situation. So they went back and figured out how
 they could make this manufacturable. So they ended up creating these
 little tiny tie cut pieces of rubber that they would glue onto the
 circuit board to keep the antenna away from the display cable.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow. Wow. So that was, basically, was just, inserting
 something in there and then it worked?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah, it wasn't exactly duct tape, but that was the
 equivalent of duct tape

paragraph
 🎙: It was pretty close.

paragraph
 ⌚️: It was pretty close. Yeah.

paragraph
 🎙: So you guys launched this product in Christmas of 2009, and
 it was a pretty successful product launch. You had 25,000 orders and
 sounds like you're off to the races, but I guess even with this
 success, when you went out to raise money, this is 2010, were
 investors more excited or was it still a challenge to get more
 investors in?

paragraph
 ⌚️: It was still a challenge. And at the time, it wasn't,
 "Okay, I guess you guys are having some success, consumers are buying
 the product, et cetera." And they congratulated us on that. But they
 were very scared of hardware businesses. I think there had been a lot
 of really high profile failures in the consumer electronics industry.
 And so, it was very difficult for us to raise money. I remember, we
 had a spreadsheet of target VCs. I think there are 40 names that we
 put on that list. And literally, we went to number 40 before we were
 able to raise money.

title3 Raising money from VCs: 40 nos.

paragraph
 🎙: And just giving the same pitch, again, again, answering the
 same questions?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Same pitch. We're in San Francisco driving down 101 to
 Sand Hill Road, constantly giving the same pitch to 40 VCs. That's
 probably the one thing I didn't like about that whole time period was,
 I hate giving the same pitch over and over and hearing the same
 questions and same objections, et cetera. That was not a fun or
 stimulating time for me.

title3 Raising $8M (2010)

paragraph
 🎙: All right. Eventually, the 40th investor does decide to give
 you some money. I think you raised about $8 million. And at this
 point, were you able to then have a proper office and a staff. Were
 you able to begin to recruit real full-time engineers and developers
 and people like that?

paragraph
 ⌚️: We were. We did that with the round that was right after
 our first $2 million institutional round. We hired a bunch of customer
 support personnel. I interviewed and hired our first head of sales. I
 interviewed and hired someone to finally run all of our manufacturing
 and operations, which was still a job that I was doing. I was still
 issuing all the [POS] and managing the inventory. And I think we were
 really fortunate because the early management team that we hired in
 those days pretty much made it up to and passed our IPO, which I think
 rarely happens.

title3 Building a community

paragraph
 🎙: It's so crazy to think about it now. But I think early on,
 with the Fitbit, the idea was to be part of a bigger community. Like
 the data from your activity would be available. You would just go to a
 site and you could see it and you could see everybody else's because
 the idea was, "We're all part of this together." But I think early on,
 some users were tracking sex. And when you started to hear about these
 things was your reaction like, "Oh my god, I never even thought about
 this being a privacy thing. I always thought that people would just
 want to share stuff."

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. This was still the early days of sharing things like
 that. And I found out about it because I saw this tweet about someone
 going, "Hey, if you do this Google search, you'll see," because Google
 was indexing all our public pages where people are logging things that
 people had made public. "You could find out all the sexual activities
 that people are logging on Fitbit." And I saw that, I'm like, "Oh my
 god, this is not good." That ended up being the first real PR crisis
 for the company. And it was happening over the 4th of July weekend. So
 I had to call an emergency board meeting. We had to scramble to delete
 all that stuff, turn everything private.

paragraph
 🎙: Because the default setting, initially, when you got to
 Fitbit was, it's not private, it's open. Because the idea was, it was
 going to be a big community of people trying to get fit.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. I mean, we made a lot of things private by default.
 We made sure that people's weight was private because we thought that
 would be sensitive, but we didn't think that people's activities,
 there wasn't any harm in doing that and we just didn't realize that
 people would start logging that.

paragraph
 🎙: And just to be clear, people who logged sexual activity, this
 was not a category that you offered up, it was just people were
 voluntarily deciding to just log that as one of their activities.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Well, it was a category, but it wasn't something that we
 had realized. We use this database from the government that was
 thousands of different activities that people would do.

paragraph
 🎙: Oh, I see. 

paragraph
 ⌚️: And so, it was an option. We just didn't think people
 would with log that.

paragraph
 🎙: You were just naive about that.

paragraph
 ⌚️: We were naive. We were like, "Okay, this is a government
 database of activities. It must be fine." That was quite a shock and a
 wake up call for us.

title3 $76M in revenue (2012)

paragraph
 🎙: Fitbit for the first couple of years was, a, still a clip.
 Mainly a clip. And then, I think really 2011, you released the first
 product, Christmas of 2009, you've got 2010. By 2011, just business
 exploded, 5X growth from 2011, 2012. You went from $15 million in
 revenue to $76 million in revenue. What was going on? Was it just this
 self-generating phenomenon? Were you surprised by it? Were you've
 investing in marketing? Was it just unearned media, just people
 reporting on it? What was going on?

paragraph
 ⌚️: I think, the primary reason is, because we had baked in
 this social element, this community element into it from the very
 beginning, it ended up being a very viral product. So one family
 member would get it, and to really realize the potential, the
 community aspect and the competitive aspect, you had to have someone
 else as well. So they'd either buy it for their spouse or their
 parents and they would start competing and then they'd buy it for
 their friends and they'd try to get their friends to buy the product.

paragraph
 🎙: So they could each see how many steps you were... Because I
 remember this, I remember this in NPR. People were wearing Fitbits and
 they were talking and there was, I think there was even, people were
 encouraged to get Fitbits.

paragraph
 ⌚️: Exactly. It was very driven by word of mouth. And this
 viral spread was a huge driver of our growth in those days.

title3 Worrying about Competition (2013)

paragraph
 🎙: I think by 2013, you had some competitors coming in. Nike was
 making one and Jawbone was making one. I mean, I remember going to the
 TED Conference in 2013 and getting a Jawbone in my gift bag. Were you
 worried about the competition at that point, or not really?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. At that time I think people were looking at the
 success and there was even a name, coined for the whole category,
 which is quantified self. "How do I use sensors, et cetera, to measure
 everything that I'm doing in my entire life?" And so that attracted a
 lot of competition that you said. And I'd have to say the competitive
 aspect was definitely worrying at the time, especially with Nike and
 Jawbone.

paragraph
 🎙: Because they're so huge.

paragraph
 ⌚️: There are huge. I mean, Nike, obviously, it's a
 multi-billion dollar, multi-national company with a lot of media
 dollars. I remember when they announced the FuelBand, they had all
 these celebrity athletes at the announcement and we're like, "Oh god,
 that's insane."

paragraph
 🎙: And yet, by 2014 you had 67% of the activity tracking
 marketplace. I mean, Fitbit was just totally dominating the
 marketplace. I mean, were you and Eric doing victory laps and
 high-fiving each other and thinking back to all those doubters? I
 mean, what was going on?

paragraph
 ⌚️: I think we were still pretty, I don't know if scared is
 the right word. I think, it's still very, very cautious. Nothing was
 guaranteed. There was a lot of competition that was emerging. We still
 had a lot of internal challenges in the business, scaling production,
 scaling the company, et cetera. Again, a lot of fires for us to be
 solving on a day-to-day basis. And I remember occasionally we'd always
 check in and say, "Hey, when do you think we'll know we're going to
 make it?" And we'd say, "I think we'll know in six months." And we
 kept saying that every six months. It was pretty much an ongoing
 thing, pretty much up to the IPO.

title3 The IPO (2015)

paragraph
 🎙: 2015 was a huge turning point for you in many ways. You go
 public, I think your market cap, I read a certain point, reached $10
 billion. That year, 2015, the Apple Watch is released and they stopped
 selling Fitbit in their stores. At the time you were quoted saying,
 I'm not really worried about this because it's a huge market. It's a
 $200 billion market. The Apple Watch is just crammed with a bunch of
 stuff, or smartwatches are crowned with a bunch of stuff. And what
 we're doing as something simpler." Was that, what you were saying
 publicly, because I don't know, you be felt like you should be saying
 that or did you really think that was true that the Apple Watch
 wouldn't actually have much of an impact?

title3 The Apple Watch (2015)

paragraph
 ⌚️: We were definitely concerned with Apple. I mean, this was
 the preeminent technology, and especially a hardware company at the
 time with an amazing brand. We had faced off Philips and Nike and
 Jawbone, which were in their rights, very big competitors, especially
 Nike. We did feel very strongly that our product had very clear
 advantages. It was a simpler product. If you looked at the Apple
 Watch, that was announced at that time, I think everyone will admit
 maybe even Apple, that it was a product that didn't quite know what it
 was supposed to be used for. With the launch of the first Apple Watch,
 I don't really think that that had an actual impact on the trajectory
 of the business. It wasn't the product that it would later become. And
 the industry wasn't where it would eventually evolve either.

paragraph
 🎙: I mean, but eventually, the industry did change. I mean,
 Apple Watch got really popular. I think, by 2016, Fitbit's stock had
 dropped by 75% over the course of a year. I mean, you and Eric were
 running a publicly traded company and the stock was just tumbling.
 What did you think? I mean, I can't imagine that was pleasant for you.

title3 Running a Public Company

paragraph
 ⌚️: No, it was definitely a stressful period. And you could
 argue, well, maybe we shouldn't even have been valued at 10 billion in
 the first place. And I think in a lot of times it's a question of
 perception. If we had never hit that 10 billion and we had steadily
 grown into the 2 billion, I think people's perceptions and just
 psychology about the whole situation would have been different than
 going to 10 and falling to two. And it was a very challenging period
 because as a private company, despite challenges, your valuation
 doesn't change very often. It only changes when you raise money, which
 could happen once a year, once every two years. So if you hit a bump
 in the road, your employees don't really feel it.

paragraph
 ⌚️: We had a product recall where, if we had been a public
 company, our valuation would have plummeted immediately, but at the
 time we were private. So we just told the employees, "Hey, look, this
 is the challenge. It's pretty serious, but here are the steps that
 we're going to take to get through it." And everyone rallied together.
 But when you're being measured every day in real-time-

paragraph
 🎙: By the stock price.

paragraph
 ⌚️: ... By the stock price, you're not really given a lot of
 breathing room to try to fix things.

title3 On Critical Feedback

paragraph
 🎙: Even though you were introducing new products, revenue was
 declining every year from the time you went public. And I read an
 article about something that you did in 2017. And I'm really just
 curious to get your take on it, because I actually think it's really
 courageous, but also probably super stressful and difficult, which is,
 you asked your employees to submit an evaluation of the company and of
 you. And then you sat in front of them to hear the results of this
 evaluation and it wasn't good. You even had some employees who wrote
 letters to the board asking that you be removed as CEO. I can't
 imagine that was easy for you to hear.

paragraph
 ⌚️: I don't know if I've heard that particular feedback
 directly, but clearly the survey results were not great. I have
 jokingly think, probably used to hearing very critical feedback
 because of my parents. I don't think there was a moment where they're
 truly happy with anything that I did. I remember even when I took the
 SATs and I got my score back, it was a pretty good score, but my dad
 just honed in on clearly the areas that I had not done well. I don't
 think I have a huge ego. I mean, I do have an ego, I think it's human
 to have one, but my primary focus was, "How do I get things back on
 track?"

paragraph
 🎙: You had, there was a quote from somebody in an article. It
 was an anonymous quote. It said, "At a certain point, we're focused on
 the right things. We had the ability, and have the ability to know a
 lot about our users, which you do, but our users don't want to be told
 what they did." In other words, they don't want to be told, "Hey, you
 exercise, you did 10 steps today." They want to be told what to do.
 Like how to get better. And the quote was, "This was the greatest
 missed opportunity." And I know you've made a pivot since then, but
 was that a fair assessment at the time in 2017, that you were too
 focused on telling people what they've accomplished rather than
 telling them what they need to do?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. I think there are ultimately two big things that
 were driving the headwinds in the business. First of all, I think we
 were really behind in launching a competitive smartwatch at the time.
 People were-

paragraph
 🎙: Competitive to...

paragraph
 ⌚️: Competitive to Apple. It was clear that the industry,
 consumers were moving to that category and we were seeing that in our
 sales. So in a very short period of time, our tracker business fell by
 $800 million in revenue. And at the time, at our peak, we were
 doing about 2.1 billion in revenue.

paragraph
 🎙: Wow.

paragraph
 ⌚️: So we had $800 million hole, and we finally launched our
 smartwatch, but it was only sufficient to fill that hole very barely.
 We hadn't transformed the software into giving people guidance and
 advice. And it also ties to our failure at the time to quickly
 diversify our revenue stream beyond just hardware to a services
 business that-

paragraph
 🎙: Like a subscription.

title3 The Subscription Service

paragraph
 ⌚️: Exactly. We were so focused on growing our hardware
 business because that was what was bringing in the money, that was
 what the retailers wanted, et cetera. And one of the mistakes I made
 was not setting up enough time, enough focus to building the
 subscription part of the business that actually answered those pivotal
 questions for our users.

paragraph
 🎙: As many, many companies find themselves in a successful
 companies that have a successful legacy product, this is crazy
 talking, but a legacy product for your company, which is only 10 years
 old or 12 years old. You could argue that the Fitbit product is your
 legacy product, right? And that, as any company with a legacy product
 realizes, they've got to make a pivot. Like for American Express, it
 was traveller's checks for 100 years. That's how they made their
 money. And they had to pivot into other things, there is travel
 services and credit cards and so on. It sounds like in 2019, you
 really made a pivot into thinking about Fitbit, not as a hardware
 company that makes a tracker, watch, or device, like smartwatch, but a
 company that really is about healthcare and is designed to pivot more
 into healthcare data and analysis. Is that fair? Is that right?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah. I think that's fair. I think we stopped thinking of
 ourselves as a device company and more of as a behavior change company
 because that's effectively what people were buying our products and
 services to do, was to change their behavior in a really positive way.
 And not only individual people, but companies as well. Companies who
 in the US, especially bear the direct costs of the care of their
 employees. We started thinking about ourselves as a behavior change
 company and figuring out what are the products and services that
 really deliver that both to people and to businesses.

title3 The Google Acquisition (2019)

paragraph
 🎙: So we get to the end of last year where Google announces that
 they were going to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/google-is-acquiring-fitbit/">buy Fitbit, $2.1 billion</a>. We should mention that,
 at the time of this recording, it hasn't closed yet. To me, it makes
 perfect sense. If I'm you or Eric, I would have done it. I would've
 said, "$2.1 billion, that's great. That's a great outcome because now
 with Google, we've got access to their dollars and their research labs
 and all the people who work there and the analytics and our ability to
 really go to the next level." Why did it make sense from your
 perspective to sell to Google?

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah, that's a very complicated and emotionally fraught
 question, but last year our board met and it was pretty clear to
 everybody that we had a lot of challenges in the business. We weren't
 profitable. There was a lot of competition out there from the likes of
 Apple, from Samsung, some emerging Chinese competitors, but there was
 a lot of just great things going on in the company. I was so excited
 about our product roadmap, about things that were in our pipeline, all
 the advanced research that we were doing around health and sensors. I
 would look at our product roadmap every day and just come away super
 excited about that. And then also be confronted with a lot of the
 business challenges as well.

paragraph
 ⌚️: And for me, most importantly it was about a legacy and I
 wanted the Fitbit brand and what we did to continue onwards for a
 very, very long time. And we just had to figure out the best way to do
 it, whether it was as an independent company or within a larger
 company. That was really what was most important.

paragraph
 🎙: I imagine that there are some details you can't talk about
 for obvious reasons, but as of this recording, we're talking in
 mid-April, there is a hold on the Google acquisition. The department
 of justice is doing an investigation because there's some interest
 groups who have said, "Hey, we don't think that Google should have
 access to all of this data. That Fitbit has 28 million users. This is
 incredible trove of health data." Is that causing you stress right now
 that there is this justice department holdup on the acquisition?

paragraph
 ⌚️: No. And it's because sometimes the press does like to
 sensationalize things, but the process that we're undergoing right now
 with the department of justice and also with the EU and some other
 countries around the world is pretty normal for acquisitions of the
 size. In fact, it's required. Really, the whole reviews about the
 anti-competitive element, and especially around the wearable market
 share. That's just something that we have to convince regulators that,
 "This doesn't reduce competition in the marketplace."

paragraph
 🎙: As far as you know, the situation now with the lockdowns and
 the pandemic does not have any impact on Google's interest or
 commitment to making this happen.

paragraph
 ⌚️: No, I think everyone's thinking towards the long-term,
 fingers crossed is that we do find ourselves through this COVID-19
 situation and that there is life beyond that. Maybe it comes back
 slowly, but I think everyone is thinking, "What does this whole
 category look like in time span of years? How?" And I think what, one
 of the things that COVID-19 has shown is that, especially if you look
 at healthcare, this idea of remote health care, remote monitoring,
 people healthy outside of a hospital setting is actually really
 important.

paragraph
 🎙: Super. It's going to totally change... I've had a video call
 with my doctor just for a quick question. It's actually super
 convenient.

title3 The Future of Medicine

paragraph
 ⌚️: Exactly. And if during these telemedicine visits, if they
 have a snapshot in summary of what you've been up to and what your
 health has been outside of that visit, and almost be predictive in
 that way, I mean, I think that can be really groundbreaking in the way
 medicine gets practiced. And this whole time period is merely
 accelerating that transition.

paragraph
 🎙: When you think about all of the things that you have done
 professionally and your successes, you made a lot of money. I mean,
 you're extremely wealthy and wealthier than your parents could have
 ever imagined you would be, or they would be. They took a huge risk to
 come to the US and had all these little mom-and-pop stores. How much
 of that do you think is because of your intelligence and skill and how
 much do you attribute to luck?

title3 Closing thoughts

paragraph
 ⌚️: Yeah, that's always a tricky question to answer. I think,
 very fortunate to have grown up with my parents. Just having seen them
 persevere through life, you get the realization that nothing really
 comes easy. That it does take a lot of just grinding away at things
 that at the time seem unpleasant. I think those are good traits and
 very fortunate to have parents like that who sacrificed a lot to put
 me in great schools over time, even though they started from some
 humble beginnings. But also, have learned a lot of ways, gotten some
 lucky breaks where things could have gone the wrong way very, very
 quickly. Ultimately, I attribute it to a little bit of all of that. I
 think it's not fair to say that everything is luck because then I
 think you start to discount the actual things, actions that you can
 take on your own to affect the future. And that's really important.

paragraph
 🎙: That's James Park, co-founder of Fitbit. And here's a number
 for you, 34,642,772, that is how many steps James has tracked since he
 first put on that balsa wood Fitbit prototype. At least as of this
 recording. It's about 15,430 miles or 24,832 kilometers. And thanks so
